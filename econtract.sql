Không trả tiền cho Speakers, nếu có chi phí thêm thì chỉ là những chi phí cho meetup như thuê địa điểm, nước uống.<br>4.

The claim was that, despite its current 40% market share, folks should start looking at alternatives for a better experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first developer interviewed for this piece was the CEO of Storyblok, Dominik Angerer. Storyblok is a headless CMS, a competitor to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second person interviewed for the article was Doeke Leeuwis, the founder and technical director for Story of AMS. The agency focuses on headless eCommerce. <em>What is one of the three platforms it uses?</em> If you guessed Storyblok, you would have gotten it right. Bonus points if you predicted it was listed first of the three in their marketing material.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third developer interviewed was Mitchel van Bever, who also works for Story of AMS. The company has been featured multiple times on the Storyblock blog and is a featured case study.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Are you starting to see a pattern yet?</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you read through the rest of the article, you will note that the post was sponsored by Storyblok. At least they were honest about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Somehow I believe most readers would have skipped the article if that was posted before the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is easy to find developers who dislike WordPress. But, you lose credibility when writing a piece that features interviewees who are either directly sponsoring or benefitting from the story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The centerpiece for the entire story hinged on the <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2019\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020\">2020</a> Stack Overflow annual developer survey. There is a lot to glean from the data provided by over 65,000 workers in the field. However, the article merely focused on a single point: WordPress was voted the most dreaded language or technology at 67% in the last year. Everything else centered on what those with a vested interest in Storyblok had to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could talk about scalability, but with WordPress.com as a prime example of running the WordPress software at scale, do we really need to?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could talk about flexibility, but when WordPress has more free third-party plugins (59,000+) than Storyblok has in total live websites (<a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/cms/Storyblok\">500+ according to BuiltWith</a>), is it really worth diving into?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a writer in the WordPress sphere, you may think I am entirely biased. That is at least partially true. However, I have worked with multiple systems. Laravel is one of my favorites, but its beautiful architecture does not always translate to quickly getting a job done in the same way as WordPress. I have helped friends and family launch projects on several non-WordPress services. It all depends on what the best tool for the job is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have even created my own custom CMS for my personal blog. I felt like WordPress was overkill for what I needed. It is OK to use another tool even when you typically prefer working with something else. My custom blogging system was built just for me, but it now runs on two websites. I had another developer friend crazy enough to try it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My love for WordPress is not absolute. It is not unconditional.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I still love it. There are 1,000s of others who love working with it too, and these developers are more likely to tell you what the <em>actual</em> issues with the platform are. We can criticize it honestly because we are down in the trenches, working with the platform every day. We know it is not always the ideal programming experience. We know it has some legacy baggage. Despite its warts, we have built something that most others only dream of doing. We have created a vast community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you thought it was all about who had the shiniest code, you would be wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about business competitors willing to communicate and even help others in their space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/five-for-the-future/\">Five for the Future</a>, a program where WordPress-related companies contribute to free software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forum</a> volunteers lending a helping hand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about the 100s of folks on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress</a> teams who contribute to various aspects of the project, everything from code reviews to translations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about sharing a drink with a years-long friend you just met IRL for the first time at a <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/\">WordCamp</a>, albeit mostly virtual for the last couple of years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about the <a href=\"https://wppodcasts.com/\">podcasts</a> that people produce for the love of the platform and its surrounding projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about quitting your nine-to-five to launch a new business as a plugin developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is about taking part in a movement that has allowed millions to publish on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, not every developer who participates in the annual Stack Overflow survey loves WordPress. Most of them may dread working with the platform, and that trend may very well continue. What we have is bigger. WordPress is its community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This smells like just another hit piece from a WordPress <em>competitor</em> <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wixs-negative-advertising-campaign-falls-flat-with-wordpress-developers-and-professionals\">like we have seen before</a>. At least some of the Wix videos were funny (<em>come on, you know you laughed at at least one or two of them</em>), and folks <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wix-takes-a-jab-at-wordpress-with-bewildering-new-marketing-campaign\">got free headphones from the deal</a>. This Storyblok-sponsored post just leaves a sour taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like my grandma &mdash; probably everyone&rsquo;s grandma &mdash; used to say, &ldquo;You catch more flies with honey.&rdquo; This was an opportunity to sell potential users on Storyblok&rsquo;s features. Maybe bashing competitors brings traffic, but I doubt it brings any goodwill or long-lasting benefits.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 04 Oct 2021 22:32:24 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 17: WordPressing Your Way to Digital Literacy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=11316\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:88:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/10/episode-17-wordpressing-your-way-to-digital-literacy/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29419:\"<p>In episode 17 of the WordPress Briefing, Josepha Haden Chomphosy reflects on her WordCamp US keynote and digs into how participating in open source projects can help you learn 21st Century Skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you&#8217;d like answered?

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. See, here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>00:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I want to talk to you a little bit about the digital divide, where it is, maybe a bit of where it&#8217;s headed, and which parts of the WordPress open source project and CMS can help. This is a focused look, though, so I won&#8217;t touch on some of the hurdles that everyone is aware of when you get outside of in-person environments, things like parental modeling or supervision, education on the relevance of technology, etc. This is a follow-up to the conversation that I had at WordCamp US last week—and so doing a little bit of a deeper dive here. And we&#8217;re gonna start with what exactly is the digital divide.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:23</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the digital divide is considered those who benefit from the digital age versus those who don&#8217;t; that feels like a really big concept. And the current discussion is primarily about access, or for years that has been about access anyway, especially physical access. So those who have computers versus those who do not have internet in their homes versus those who do not. But I don&#8217;t necessarily agree with that particular, really focused definition of the problem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>01:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the only problem we see is access, then the solution becomes to get cheap devices and internet to everyone, which certainly has led to more people being connected than ever before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:12</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this proliferation of devices that are considered both smart and mobile (mobile in this context, meaning handheld or pocket-sized), the discussion over the last few years has been shifting. It’s been shifting into more of a discussion around the education around the relevance of internet access, discussions around the quality of access to the Internet, and also discussions around Wi-Fi and dial-up and the surprising cost of data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:42</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But from my perspective, there are a number of really dangerous assumptions that we make when we boil it all the way down to who has access and the quality of that kind of access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>02:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first dangerous assumption is that we run the risk of conflating being tech-savvy with being digitally literate, and they&#8217;re not really the same things. The second assumption that we run the risk of is assuming that access to cellular data equals access to the internet through any other means. And also assuming that cost is always the determining factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>03:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final fairly dangerous assumption that we&#8217;re making there is that we allow ourselves the ability to mark the digital divide is fixed in our minds. Once we get enough access to everyone, we&#8217;re just done. There is no more divide. But as a way of illustration, if you think about access, not in the context of technology, like high technology, digital technology, and in the context of like writing, you probably own a writing utensil, and you probably have access to paper of some sort, which is great. But just because you have like a pencil and a piece of paper doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you home right now &#8211; I guess most of you are listening at home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean that I can send you to your desk right now. And consider you prepared to write a best-selling novel, right? Because giving you physical tools no more makes you a novelist than handing me a computer when I was a teen made me digitally literate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s talk about what it takes to be digitally literate. I&#8217;ve lumped the following skills into three groups. It&#8217;s broadly defined as 21st-century skills, but the groups that I have them in is not a comprehensive list of those 21st-century skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>04:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first group that is a large component of digital literacy is critical thinking skills. So computational thinking and problem-solving. That particular one is not new, exactly. But the computational thinking part certainly is. Not all problems are solved with code, but the basis for thinking through things procedurally is increasingly important.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:04</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one in that set is communication through multiple media, consuming communications or content through Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, or any other format, but also creating the things that communicate—writing blogs, creating videos, both calls and standalone, and forums, things like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third set in that group of critical thinking skills is around collaboration, which some people will say is more about communication. But I find that collaboration both online and in-person is a skill set all to its own. Communication only gets you so far when you&#8217;re learning to cook to collaborate with people that you don&#8217;t normally work with. And so, I have lumped that into critical thinking skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>05:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second big bucket for digital literacy is actually literally digital literacy. So I have three, three things in here as well. Evaluating information is obviously incredibly important in the environment that we&#8217;re in right now, for just information’s sake. But then things like understanding the differences between copyright versus copyleft licenses, understanding the difference between an .org ending URL and a .com ending URL, and evaluating the general veracity of sources that you&#8217;re finding on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>06:32</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that group is media use and creation, understanding the difference between folks who consume and folks who create the content we have, how to find information online, and the most sensible places to keep information online. And the third area of digital literacy that I find to be vitally important is the ethics of licenses both around use and access. So again, things like copyright vs. Copy, copyleft. And specifically for WordPress, that means understanding things like the Creative Commons licenses, GPL, MIT, but then also copyright is its own complicated question unto itself. But the other things that show up for us for WordPress that show up for us with technology are also things like open access versus proprietary information and sources. And things like plagiarism versus sampling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>07:33</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And our third big bucket, which has become increasingly complex, but the third big bucket for digital literacy to my mind is actually considered something that I call life skills. So things like self-direction, knowing what you want to do next, and how to get it done. Time management is also in there, knowing how much time something will take and being able to make sure that you are getting things done over time, as opposed to trying to accomplish everything at the last second.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:03</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of these life skills is cross-cultural and social communication. The internet is tricky, right? Because it&#8217;s simultaneously incredibly insular and increasingly global. Like you can if you wanted only ever read things that already confirm your existing biases. But the very nature of the internet, the very nature of the web, means that the world is much smaller. We have more ready access faster to everyone everywhere in the world than we used to have. This means, of course, that cultural awareness is an absolute must now more than ever. This is for what it&#8217;s worth the time of year when I give this talk. And that&#8217;s because of this last part of the life skills section, which is digital citizenship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>08:54</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital citizenship generally is the second week of October 2 or the third week of October. And it&#8217;s one of my favorite weeks because it is something that comes up all the time in our ecosystem. It comes up all the time and open source in general, but certainly for WordPress. So those are our three big buckets of digital literacy, a subset of 21st-century skills as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:22</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of stuff, I know. And it&#8217;s also really hard to figure out how you can learn any of those skills, and from my experience, I really believe that WordPress as an open source project can help people learn those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>09:43</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once upon a time, ages and ages ago, my mother told me that in order for me to become a better writer, I would have to read and in order to become a better communicator, it would probably help if I spent a little bit more time writing, and I have always felt that the same must be true for all the things that we learn, you find a positive example and study it to become better. Or, depending on what you&#8217;re learning and how you&#8217;re trying to learn it, you find a passive example of something that you want to be able to do better from an active standpoint and participate in that so that your active production of the other part is better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are a few parts of the WordPress project and WordPress itself that can help with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>10:31</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are first a few really specific teams; if you&#8217;re contributing to a team like Themes, or Plugins, or Core, the three areas of those digital literacy skills that you have an opportunity to learn there. For critical thinking, you&#8217;re going to run into problem-solving and computational thinking. You’re also going to run into distributed collaboration, which was really important as just a concept when I first wrote this talk. And now it is currently really important as a reality because we have a bunch of companies that are going to either remote work or partially distributed or fully distributed. And that&#8217;s the way that WordPress has worked for a pretty long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>11:19</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve always felt like it was important because it was important to WordPress, but it&#8217;s also becoming increasingly an important part of just how to exist in the world at the moment. For those three teams, the things that you can really tap into and practice for the life skill section are digital literacy, nope, digital citizenship, self-direction, and time management obviously comes up in any open source project because you are volunteering your time and it is up to you to kind of decide how much you can commit or not various other parts of time management and directing one&#8217;s own project. Now, but you also get the opportunity to test and practice your cross-cultural communication, social communication and learning what it means to collaborate across cultures in that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:15</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the digital literacy side, you also get a little bit of that information evaluation and synthesis for what it&#8217;s worth. And then obviously get to learn more about the ethics of various types of licenses and how use and access relate to those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:35</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a team or two; these are not really teams or twos. These are things that you can do that are either solo activities or group activities. One is working or checking out the support forums, and the other is blogging. We’ll start with support forums.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>12:52</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re doing this as a group activity, there are a couple of extra things that that you can practice here. But suppose you&#8217;re doing it as a solo, just way to give back to the project sort of thing or way to learn some of these skills sort of thing. In that case, you can get almost all of these digital literacy skills woven into working in the support forums, depending on what&#8217;s happening in the moment and the questions people have brought up. But for critical thinking, obviously, you get some problem solving in there, not as much the computational thinking as the procedural thinking part. But you certainly also get to tap into communication with multiple types of media, collaboration in person and online, depending on whether you&#8217;re doing this as a solo effort or a group effort. And then, of course, research, which I didn&#8217;t really bring up in any of those groupings for digital literacy, is certainly a very important part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>13:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the digital literacy grouping of skills related to digital literacy, you get to work on evaluating information and, depending on how complicated an answer might be. You can also get that opportunity to practice synthesizing complex information and research, a digital literacy skill. And then, once people have responded to a topic you&#8217;ve answered, you also get to tap into that life skill section. You get to be you get the opportunity to practice digital citizenship related to synchronous or asynchronous conversation. You also get to see more about how cross-cultural communication and collaboration works and social communication across those various boundaries that naturally show up when we&#8217;re working across cultures that way. And as I mentioned previously, information synthesis, as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>14:53</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second one that I have mentioned can be like a solo effort or a group effort, depending on what you do. Blogging, for most people who use WordPress, is probably the most common application of how WordPress can help you do stuff. So I often see it as the most relevant and the most immediately accessible to anyone. But you know, you got to meet people where they are. So, I would strongly believe that this is our best way to help people learn these things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>15:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So blogging for the critical thinking sorts of things, you have an opportunity to practice communication across mediums. You will probably get an opportunity to practice your research skills, chances are, you&#8217;re going to get the opportunity to practice some problem solving, and honestly, like if you&#8217;re hosting your site, problem-solving is going to come up when using WordPress as soon as you add in plugins and themes, because you sometimes kind of have to figure out what&#8217;s working and what&#8217;s not, and what&#8217;s playing nicely with other things and what&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s possible that with blogging, you&#8217;re also going to have an opportunity to get to practice some distributed collaboration. But that&#8217;s probably going to depend on what you&#8217;re doing with your site as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:30</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Licenses and how they apply to the thing that you&#8217;re using feel a bit different when you are the one who&#8217;s creating. And so learning about how those things work and don&#8217;t work and how they can best suit what you&#8217;re trying to do. Blogging is absolutely an excellent opportunity to dig into that a bit and learn a bit more about that. As far as your life skills go,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>16:56</p>\n\n\n\n<p>that&#8217;s where you, again, get to practice some digital citizenship by figuring out who your audiences are and also when you have to communicate with them via the comments or any other way that you have built up a feedback mechanism there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:11</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Self-direction obviously will come into this, maybe time management if you are blogging on, I was gonna say on a paid basis, but that&#8217;s not really I don&#8217;t know, on a project basis, like some of us are students and have to write things based on deadlines. And so, you know, self-direction, potentially time management, always cross-cultural communication, social communication, research, all of these things show up in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>17:41</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, I really believe in this concept of how blogging and bringing people into maintaining a website can teach you all of these skills. Because when I was younger, I was a bad communicator. And now, I am across the board known for my effective communication and my ability to work across cultures. And so the defining moment, which was like a four-year moment, and so not necessarily a moment, but the thing that really made all the difference was when my mom challenged me to write every single day. She had noted that I was not necessarily great at getting from one point to the next. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily great at building my arguments when I had to explain something to people. And she suggested that writing every day would help me tap into this big thing about communication and working with other people collaboration, all of that. And as an adult on the other side of it. Like, I thought she was super wrong when I was younger, because don&#8217;t we all think our parents are wrong when we&#8217;re younger. But as an adult on the other side of it, not only was that an opportunity for me to literally learn how to communicate better. But it also, when I look at it, gave me access to opportunities to practice all sorts of 21st-century skills and digital literacy skills in an environment that was relatively safe. And so, I am a big proponent of this particular one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>19:26</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another team that helps us tap into and practice a lot of our digital literacy skills is the Documentation team. I recommend that you let this be a supervised activity if you&#8217;re doing this with students because, you know, it&#8217;s a wiki. You can put weird things in there on accident or just inaccurate things. So for critical thinking, the primary skill that you&#8217;re going to be able to practice if you&#8217;re working on documentation is collaboration. You would think that it was also like information synthesis and information evaluation. But for a lot of the work that we&#8217;re doing, the documentation exists. And what we&#8217;re looking at is trying to figure out where it no longer matches what is currently in the CMS, or currently in the project or currently in the team, whatever it is that you&#8217;re working on at that moment. And so, it&#8217;s a strong collaborative effort in the WordPress project. You have to have done the general work to figure out what needs to be changed in the documentation. But a lot of times, you need to figure out who has access to make the changes, what has prevented us from making changes in the past, and things like that. And so I say, collaboration is the only one to learn and critical thinking, but it&#8217;s actually a really big one and can take a fair amount of effort in this particular context.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>20:49</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the digital literacy aspect, of course, there is evaluating information. But this particular type of information evaluation is a little different for documentation. And this actually is true for the Documentation team, for the Training team, and also for the new Learn team. This question is true for all of them. There is a huge difference between presentation versus application of information. The way you present information for people who already know it and just need confirmation of something or are using it for reference material is really different from when people are looking at a piece of documentation that should be telling them how to accomplish something. And they try to apply it either to their own processes at the moment or apply it to teaching other people. And so evaluating information to make sure that what is presented can be applied, and all of the ways that that very complicated journey with managing information can kind of work or not, depending on how things are going in your section of the open source project at the moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>21:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third group of skills that you can really dig into in those teams, again, is digital citizenship, basically, everything is digital citizenship in WordPress because we&#8217;re just people online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>22:24</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this final grouping that we have this final team and group of skills. So the Community team is a substantial and far-ranging team; they have many things that fall into their area of expertise. And so this has traditionally kind of functioned as a linchpin around education and ensuring that that was all relevant for users and attendees of events. The Community team will remain pivotal to so many things that we do now. But now that we have really awakened the Learn team and re-enlivened that Training team, this will shift a little over time. But yes, so that grain of salt that depending on when you listen to this, if you listen to it in 2050, maybe it&#8217;s not accurate anymore. Hopefully, most of what I say is not accurate in 2050. But you know, still.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>23:27</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;Anyway! Critical thinking that&#8217;s where we were. So the critical thinking group of skills inside the Community team, you are going to have an opportunity to practice problem-solving. And frequently also procedural thinking, depending on what you&#8217;re working on in that team. Multimedia communication is absolutely true. And that&#8217;s true, whether you contribute to the team itself and make sure that the team is functioning and doing their basic tasks. Or if you are organizing an entire event, whether it&#8217;s online or offline or however that is being accomplished.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multimedia communication for this particular team is constant for all of their work and something that everyone who works on there gets to practice all the time. For digital literacy, this comes up a lot if what you&#8217;re doing is working through any sort of like programming plans, making sure that what we have in place for events is really excellent. It&#8217;s a really excellent opportunity for practicing the evaluation of information, learning more about media use and creation, and then naturally, everything to do with licenses copyright copyleft, not only for everything that we produce but then also for everyone in the ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>24:55</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This team helps so many plugins, authors and theme developers, and other groups who participate in the ecosystem understand the nuances of the GPL and why it matters so much to WordPress. And then in the life skill section, there&#8217;s the obvious life skill section, life skills that have come up for all of them—so digital citizenship, cross-cultural and social communication. But also you have the opportunity to tap into that self-direction and time management practice, which probably should also be considered in all of these teams. But, you know, things change as we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:45</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those are the most likely digital literacy skills that you would end up practicing in the Community team, depending on how you are participating in the Community team at that moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>25:59</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I said that we would talk a little bit about where this is all headed and what to do next. And like I just said, when I got lost in my own reverie, they&#8217;re like, hopefully, everything that I&#8217;ve shared here is out of date by 2050. Like, if we can come back to this particular podcast, or this presentation, or anything I&#8217;ve ever said, about digital literacy over my time with WordPress. And if we could come back to that in 2050, or, you know, I was going to say, 20 years from now, 2041 feels really close. But, you know, come back to it in the future, and say, that was all really excellent information to know at the moment. And we did do those things. And now, WordPress has proven that open source contribution and collaboration can teach all of the necessary 21st-century skills that anyone would need to survive in the world. And we did do it, that would be really cool. But I don&#8217;t think that that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re headed. Not because I don&#8217;t think people believe in what I&#8217;m saying or care about what I&#8217;m saying. But because it&#8217;s very easy to kind of let these things go at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>27:20</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if you at some point, were proficient in all of what is considered 21st-century skills, sometimes our skills don&#8217;t get used very much. And so we lose track of them. And we don&#8217;t know, or we don&#8217;t know how to teach them to other people and various ways to do that. So I hope that when we revisit this in the time capsule of the internet 20 years from now, we can say that was a great explanation. And we learned so much. And we made so many changes in such progress that now we need a new version of this. That&#8217;s really all we can do, always striving to leave the world in a better position than when we found it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy&nbsp; </strong>28:07</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, that brings us to our small list of big things. I don&#8217;t have a ton to share with you today. But what I do have to share with you is a really big deal. So we are about a week away from the Go/No-Go point of WordPress 5.9. That is the final release of the year. And as soon as we know what is a go or a no go from that meeting on October 12th,&nbsp; everyone is going just to hit the ground running. And so, if you are interested in contributing to that release, either by being a participant in the release squad or leading some part of the release squad. Absolutely. Drop by and let me know because I am interested to know who wants to learn more about doing that. And this is actually something that has gone by. I mentioned at the top that I spoke at WordCamp US.&nbsp; That is still true; I did do it. And so did a bunch of other really excellent presenters. If you missed WordCamp US on Friday, for whatever reason, because you know, life is complicated. Pretty soon, we will have the videos.

The total revamped Gallery Block is built from individual image blocks, that bring their features into the gallery: you can style each image differently, link each single image to a different URL, apply different duotone filters per image and crop images to fit into a pattern and more. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can enable this Gallery block from the <em>Gutenberg plugin&#8217;s Experiments page. </em>If you want to see what happens when your existing gallery change into the new Gallery Block, you click on <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34606\">“Update” button</a> of the the Block&#8217;s Toolbar <em>(new in 11.6)</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The refactored Gallery block is slated to come to WordPress with the 5.9 release. If you are a plugin or theme developer, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/08/20/gallery-block-refactor-dev-note/\">Glen Davies published a Dev Note last month. </a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Maggie Cabrera</strong> publish the <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/10/01/gutenberg-themes-week-of-september-27-2021/\">67th Gutenberg + Themes Round-up</a></strong> post from the Themes team with a list of ongoing discussions on Full-Site Editing, Global Styles, and Design Tools.

It&#8217;s the place to be part of the discussion and influence development and designs. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shaun Andrews</strong> posted the recording and summary of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/09/30/sept-2021-show-tell-recording/\"><strong>Design team&#8217;s Show &amp; Tell meeting.</strong></a> The meeting is mostly meant to catch up all design contributors on various stages of their work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this meeting </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Tammie Lister</strong> talked about Block Support and how it is handled for individual blocks, in theme.json and block.json</li><li><strong>Javier Arce</strong> shared his designs for editing background in an image block images, and </li><li><strong>Channing Ritter</strong> discussed her exploration around Theme switching in the Site Editor. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Full Site Editing and Themes </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now many conversations about Full-Site Editing and how can site builders, agencies, designers and freelancers get a handle on the various pieces, that make up Full-Site Editing. <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> published a longer post on <a href=\"https://nomad.blog/2021/09/29/sharing-approaches-for-fse-feature-adoption/\"><strong>Sharing Approaches for Adoption of Full-Site Editing</strong></a> in the WordPress ecosystem.

I found remarkable the comparison of this new theme with his latest classic theme: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Tove contains a theme.json file that specifies supported settings and styles, HTML template files and template parts used by the Site Editor, a couple of stylesheets, placeholder image assets, a folder with block patterns, and a functions.php file to enqueue assets and register block patterns and styles. That’s Tove. <em>Not a single line of JavaScript, and other than the functions.php file and a empty index.php file, no PHP either.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Compare that to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/eksell-wordpress-theme/\">Eksell</a>, my latest (and probably last?) free classic theme.

The duo has made continual updates to the plugin since. In the past couple of months, they have added deep integration with Easy Digital Downloads. They are also planning to build around more eCommerce-related plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge mentioned that using the Logtivity service allows site owners to track and log activity at scale. While small sites could get by with an on-site solution, it can be harder to do while growing. &ldquo;This offers a strong alternative to using a plugin because you don&rsquo;t need to store huge amounts of data on your own server,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The service provides graphs so that end-users can visualize their data, but they can also dive directly into the logs and look at specific actions. Users can also set up unlimited alert notifications through email or Slack and download reports as CSV files.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Site dashboard showing different chart types.\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/logtivity/\">Logitivity WordPress plugin</a> is free to download and install, but it merely serves as a bridge to the commercial service. The <a href=\"https://logtivity.io/pricing/\">pricing page</a> has three tiers that start at $9.50/month and run to $49.50. The rates primarily differ on the number of logs generated, user access, and length of data retention. However, each tier can be used on an unlimited number of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been running the service on WP Tavern for a couple of weeks. There are not many things I would want to track specific to this site other than posts published and commenting numbers. The short-term data has not told me much that I did not know already. However, I could see how these logs could come in handy over months or years. If we were running an eCommerce website, the information could be invaluable.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Viewing a specific set of logs based on an action.\n\n\n\n<p>Users can create reports of specific logs and display them as either bar or line charts. These can be generated based on an action, such as &ldquo;Post Published&rdquo; or &ldquo;Comment Created.&rdquo; Users can also add a specific context, such as a post ID. For example, a user could display a chart for each product file download through the plugin&rsquo;s deep integration with Easy Digital Downloads.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the type of thing that the team has in mind at the moment. The primary use case since launch has been logging eCommerce activity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;People who run eCommerce sites need to track registrations, subscription changes, file downloads, license key activations, login activity, and more,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;eCommerce site owners need this for customer support and also to deal with refund requests and chargebacks.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, each of the service&rsquo;s features is handled via the Logtivity site. The team has plans to bring them into the WordPress admin interface. However, it could be late 2021 or early 2022 before the integration happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d love to bring Logtivity data directly into WordPress,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;And because there&rsquo;s no need to worry about Logtivity slowing down your site, we have some interesting ideas for how and where user activity can be displayed in the WordPress admin area.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How It Started and Where It Is Going</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Burge serves as the marketing brains behind the project. His primary WordPress-related business is <a href=\"https://publishpress.com/\">PublishPress</a>, but his customers had asked for a project like Logitivity for several years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ralph Morris started Logtivity for a customer at the web dev agency he works at,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;The customer&rsquo;s site has around 100,000 users and gets a great deal of activity every day, from new registrations and subscriptions to resources being downloaded and cancellations. They were using a WordPress plugin to track customer activity, but as the number of logs grew, this process took longer and longer and became more clunky to perform. The final straw was when they were unable to perform the CSV exports, as it would keep timing out. Ralph scratched the itch and built a little MVP. After a few weeks, he showed it to his colleagues and got permission from his boss to offer it to the client to be the first user, and a little while later, the first paying customer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said the two connected thanks to Iain Poulson, who recently <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/alex-denning-and-iain-poulson-launch-flipwp-an-acquisitions-marketplace-for-wordpress-companies\">co-launched the acquisitions marketplace FlipWP.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Ralph lives really close to where I grew up in Hampshire, England,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;We got our heads together and decided on a partnership: Ralph as the developer and myself as the marketer.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside of integrating more directly with the WordPress admin, the Logtivity team has a roadmap that will keep them busy for a while. Topping that list are more integrations with third-party plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Our primary use-case is eCommerce sites, so WooCommerce is central to our plans,&rdquo; said Burge. &ldquo;But we also plan deeper integrations with more plugins that WordPress eCommerce sites use, including LearnDash, MemberPress, Paid Memberships Pro, and more.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several players in the space are moving toward broad integrations across the ecosystem. Chris Lema talked about it being a vital strategy for business growth with StellarWP&rsquo;s recent <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/stellarwp-acquires-learning-management-system-learndash\">acquisition of LearnDash</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Burge also noted that his team plans to continue improving the service&rsquo;s alert system. &ldquo;In future versions of Logtivity, you&rsquo;ll be able to send more flexible alerts to more channels. We also plan to provide SMS alerts for your most important notifications.&rdquo;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 21:49:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"Akismet: Version 4.2.1 of the Akismet WordPress Plugin is Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"http://blog.akismet.com/?p=2130\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://blog.akismet.com/2021/10/01/version-4-2-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:559:\"<p>Version 4.2.1 of <a href=\"http://wordpress.org/plugins/akismet/\">the Akismet plugin for WordPress</a> is now available.</p>\n<p>This update contains a fix for a bug in version 4.2 that could cause AMP validation errors on some sites, depending on the template they were using.</p>\n<p>To upgrade, visit the Updates page of your WordPress dashboard and follow the instructions.

When defining a block, developers can now use the lock attribute to designate whether a block can be moved or removed. The PR introduces parts of the locking support mechanisms proposed by Matias Ventura in a separate <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29864\">issue</a> earlier this year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ventura explained that while the editor already has template locking support to prevent inserting or moving blocks (i.e. for custom post type templates), it doesn&rsquo;t yet offer much granular control or a UI for the different locking states. He identified block themes as an important use case for establishing a new block-level API for representing&nbsp;<code>lock</code>&nbsp;status. Block themes may necessitate the ability to lock down key elements, such as preventing the removal of the post-content for a single post template. If you have ever played around with the template editor then you have likely discovered how easy it is to remove important elements by accident. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img /><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29864\">Block locking UI mockup</a></div>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Another use case that we&rsquo;re building for is having a Checkout Block with different blocks that act as fundamental steps,&rdquo; WooCommerce and Gutenberg engineer Seghir Nadir said. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t want people to delete or move those steps since they&rsquo;re fundamental and their order is also important, but we want to allow people to select them, access settings, and insert blocks in between them.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During this week&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/09/30/editor-chat-summary-29th-september-2021/\">core editor chat</a>, Paal Joachim Romdahl highlighted the need for a locking mechanism for Reusable blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;At the moment it is too easy to make an accidental change to a Reusable block,&rdquo; Romdahl said. &ldquo;I worry that only having the hover overlay and the initial click [to] select the parent Reusable block is just not good enough, that we soon should get a lock mechanism in place. There is a lot of feedback from users who have accidentally deleted the inner contents of the blocks and wondered what happened.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Romdahl has created several <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32461\">issues</a> about to the possibility of <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31163\">adding a locking mechanism to the inline toolbar for reusable blocks</a>, where users would need to unlock to edit the contents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the foundational infrastructure is in place for managing lock control at the block-type level, contributors can begin building a UI to control it, as outlined in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29864\">Locking and TemplateLocking</a> issue. Ventura said future iterations should include a UI that indicates which blocks are user-editable and also display block status in the list view and block inspector.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 05:00:14 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:6;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg 11.6 Improves the Global Styles UI, Adds Child Theme Support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123580\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:203:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-11-6-improves-the-global-styles-ui-adds-child-theme-support?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gutenberg-11-6-improves-the-global-styles-ui-adds-child-theme-support\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6450:\"<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Gutenberg 11.6 <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v11.6.0\">landed yesterday</a>. Contributors added dozens of enhancements and bug fixes. Admittedly, there was not a whole lot that excited me as a user about this release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31623\">Typography options</a> for the Post Title block. <em>Nice.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31607\">Cropping</a> for the Site Logo. <em>A necessary addition.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Toolbar button for <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34606\">converting old Gallery blocks</a> to the new &mdash; still experimental &mdash; format. <em>Sweet.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the most part, the release felt like a slew of routine enhancements that have been in the pipeline for those of us closely following the plugin&rsquo;s development. Almost boring. And that is not a bad thing at all. Less excitement and smaller doses of iterative improvements can be healthy for the project and its developers. We do not always need to feel like we are chasing the next big thing. This is a well-rounded release that polishes many areas, from navigation to widgets to general block enhancements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were two features that I am happy to see movement on. That is the site editor&rsquo;s Global Styles system and child theme support.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Global Styles Updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<img />Default site editor look with Global Styles panel open.\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">Global Styles is the system that will truly connect end-users to theme developers and vice versa for the first time in WordPress history. We have made some attempts at this, such as the customizer. However, this feature will handle it on top of the standardized block system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Essentially, themes will <em>talk</em> to WordPress through their <code>theme.json</code> files, and users will speak the same language through the Global Styles panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, imagine a theme author sets up the default text color as black and the background as white. This will appear on the front end of the site but also be reflected in the site editor. The Global Styles interface allows users to change those two colors to something they prefer.  They can also see of a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34991\">preview of their color and typography styles</a> in the box at the top of the panel.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Updating colors, preview shown in editor and at top of panel.\n\n\n\n<p>And, it does not stop at a couple of simple colors. Users can modify all sorts of design aspects like typography and spacing at the root and block levels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 11.6 adds a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34885\">navigation component</a> to the Global Styles sidebar. Overall, it feels much smoother working through the top and sub-levels while editing my theme&rsquo;s styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />Updating the global padding for the Code block.\n\n\n\n<p>This is sort of a small but vital step toward <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/34574\">overhauling the overall Global Styles interface</a>. There is still much work to be done, but I am eager to see where the Gutenberg contributors take this component in the coming weeks and months.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did run into one snag. Clicking on the Typography tab at the root level produces an error. However, it works at the block level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors also updated the old &ldquo;Aa&rdquo; icon representing the Global Styles panel with a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34871\">half-dark-half-light circle button</a>. My immediate reaction was that it was for switching between light and dark modes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/20873#issuecomment-923241684\">sentiment shared</a> by a user (from a now-deleted account) in the GitHub ticket.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Global Styles is not a new system disconnected from styles and themes, indeed is an improvement to the current themes system. If we were to consider the strength of WordPress&rsquo; past and present, we would perceive that on the dashboard, indeed a brush icon has been developed for years in people&rsquo;s memory as an association with appearance, themes, styles, personalization. Therefore, the icon that would be most comprehensible in people&rsquo;s memory regarding the new Customizer remains a brush. I say new and better Customizer, because this is how common people manifest what they understand about Global Styles. Departing from a pencil brush to yin-yang, moon, or water drop, I have not tested yet with public, but from past experience I assure you people are going to find this new icon unrelated and confusing.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Child Theme Support</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As one of the pioneers of child theming in WordPress, using them long before they were officially supported, this is something near and dear to my heart. I created my first theme shop on this foundation. I have loads of ideas about how the block paradigm can reshape the theme space, and child themes are at the center of many of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, all of the components of Full Site Editing have not entirely supported child themes until now. There are still a few pieces left to fit into the puzzle, but the system should work, mostly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Templates, template parts, and <code>theme.json</code> files from a child theme should now completely <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/34354\">overrule those from the parent</a>. These changes work on both the front end and in the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some open questions are being worked through in a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/25612\">related GitHub ticket</a>. The most crucial development is still to come, which will handle merging values between the parent and child <code>theme.json</code> files.

Grabowski, like many other business development people in the WordPress space, regards the missing new user onboarding experience as the biggest roadblock for even bigger growth of the WordPress ecosystem. Howard and Grabowski had an honest and nuanced conversation about the business case for Gutenberg First approach to WordPress products. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Grabowski took a historic view to the ongoing debate about Gutenberg being the right path for WordPress. Back in 2016, while working with Adobe and its product Spark, Grabowski became aware of many innovative web building tools. They were all block-based. It is only a fairly new concept for WordPress. “There is a lot less unknown here about the end state than some people realize.” If you are interested in the WordPress product space, I recommend you follow the link and dive into the details of things. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The future is here.

You can change the layout for post title, featured image, excerpt and link.  An early version of this was the Latest Post Block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The design team also implemented a series of Block Patterns of a few nice variations to display a post list on templates, post and pages. It&#8217;s a fun feature, and it has taken quite a long time to build. The wait was definitely worth it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is mighty and could be the most powerful feature in 5.8 as <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> headlined his post <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/query-loop-the-ins-and-outs-of-one-of-wordpress-5-8s-most-powerful-features\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>Query Loop: The Ins and Outs</strong></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allison Rivers</strong> over the Torque Magazine also published an article <a href=\"https://torquemag.io/2021/07/what-is-wordpress-5-8s-query-loop-block/\"><strong>What is the Query Loop Block?</strong></a> with lots of great insights and examples.

Ella&#8217;s post compliments Grzegorz Ziolkowski&#8217;s post: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/16/block-editor-api-changes-to-support-multiple-admin-screens-in-wp-5-8/\"><strong>Block Editor API Changes to Support Multiple Admin Screens</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/on-layout-and-content-width-in-wordpress-5-8/\"><strong>On layout and content width</strong></a> by <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/riadbenguella\">Riad Benguella</a></strong> &#8211; This is a shorter post, introducing the Settings for layout and content width and how you can adjust your theme to take advantage of them. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/29/block-based-widgets-editor-in-wordpress-5-8/\"><strong>Block-based Widgets Editor</strong></a> by <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/noisysocks\">Robert Anderson</a></strong>. He wrote: &#8220;WordPress 5.8 introduces a new&nbsp;block-based widgets editor to the Widgets screen (<code>Appearance → Widgets</code>) and&nbsp;Customizer&nbsp;(<code>Appearance → Customize → Widgets</code>).&#8221; and continues to explain the <strong>three methods</strong> (including the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/\">Classic Widget plugin</a>)  of opting out.

The team removed support for IE 11 from build and test tools and gives you more control and consistency for the document title. WordPress 5.8 also brings a consistent type for integer properties of WP_Post, WP_Term, WP_User and a bookmark object and better caching of post/page IDs for subsequent request. There are quite a few more goodies in this upcoming release.

He is a fan of the new feature and glad it made it into the WordPress core for this upcoming release. While the WPAdmin Widget screen feels like a good block editor, he wrote about the block widgets in the Customizer: &#8220;Customizer support for block widgets is light years ahead of where it was just a few short months ago. However, it feels awkward at best. There is a deep feeling of not belonging. While it was a remarkable programming feat to make the two features work together, the user experiences are nearly a decade apart.&#8221;  </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/need-a-zip-from-master/\">Need a plugin .zip from Gutenberg&#8217;s main (trunk) branch?</a></strong><br />Gutenberg Times provides daily build for testing and review. <br />Have you been using it?

The webinar is now live and welcome to our 28th Gutenberg live Q and A on this June 24th. My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack and I am your host for today&#8217;s discussion. Thank you all for watching, and it&#8217;s great to have you. And while you all come in, use the chat window to tell us where you are and where you&#8217;re watching from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today we will discuss a new way to configure themes, that is black themes, with global styles and settings file theme.json. And it will enable theme developers to centralize all the block-based settings, color palettes, font sizes, and other block-based customizations. This way you will also control which of the other block features the theme supports or does not support.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s my simple mind&#8217;s description of the new features and I&#8217;m so thrilled to have three experts on the show to go beyond this simple explanation and help theme developers to get started. I&#8217;m extremely honored to have Daisy Olsen, developer advocate at Automatic and WordPress contributor. Hey, good to have you. Also Jeff Ong, code wrangler at Automatic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong: </em>Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thanks for being here. And at last but not at least Tammie Lister, design lead at Extendify.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We&#8217;ll do some proper introduction in less than a minute. I just have a few housekeeping notes. So after the introduction, we&#8217;ll have a first round robin question and then we see a demo. Jeff was working really hard on it and I think he was the only one repairing hard for this live Q and A. And then we&#8217;ll discuss the different angles and how they get started. And then, of course, answer your question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of questions, how do you pose your questions? There&#8217;s a Q and A on the bottom of the screen, a kind of icon. You click on that and write your question. And for those watching on YouTube use the chat window next to the video player. And so saying hi. Hi, Victor. From Buenos Aires in Argentina. Awesome. Thank you for being here. All right. When you do comments and questions, so please be kind even if you disagree.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a family endeavor. All right. Well, I&#8217;m thrilled you all agreed dear panelists to come on the show and I get an hour to talk with you about your work. So, Daisy, tell us a little bit about you, where are you&#8217;re located and what is it that you do as developer advocate on the purpose project and at Automatic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Yeah. I&#8217;m Daisy Olsen and I live in New Hampshire in the United States. It&#8217;s a beautiful day here right now unlike some parts of this country that are really hot. We got the cool weather over here this week. So as a developer advocate, I talk about WordPress a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I get out and do workshops, teach classes, write documentation and just stay involved and close to the projects development so that I know what&#8217;s going on theoretically and can share that out particularly with plugin and theme developers as well as agencies and freelancers and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. So glad you&#8217;re here. Thank you. So, Tammie, thank you for coming back to the show. It&#8217;s been over three years. The last time you were on the show was just after Gutenberg was merged into Core and you were one of the three leads with Matias Ventura and Joen Asmussen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you shared a lot about the journey of Gutenberg and the philosophy behind it. So I will put the link to the show into the show notes for you who have been coming later to Gutenberg. But this year you joined the WordPress product company Extendify. So what do you do there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> First of all, has it been three years? That goodness. Time flies. So in Extendify I focus on design. So our solutions extend the editor. And then the aim is to make it even more usable for people&#8217;s purpose that they want to use it for. And I&#8217;m really, really excited about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it means that people can have the best experience from the content they&#8217;re creating, to the layout, the patterns, the styles, whatever that the editor enables, that&#8217;s really what I&#8217;m focusing on. So it&#8217;s a interesting new challenge to do. And you have blew my brain with that time span. You really have. That&#8217;s awesome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Well, it&#8217;s also over three years that Gutenberg times us. So I&#8217;ve been part of that journey so for so long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Congrats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Nothing really held my attention for so long. And normally I get really bored. Well, I&#8217;m also really happy that Extendify took over <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/editorplus/\">Editor Plus</a> from Munir Kumal and the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-options/\">EditorsKit</a> from Jeffrey Carandang. So, those have a more sustainable way now to access because both Munir and Jeffrey seem to have&#8230; Munir joined you, but Jeffrey moved on to be a consultant at , I think, 10up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> It&#8217;s so really exciting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. I imagine. So thank you also to Jeff Ong for joining us today as well. You&#8217;re a code wrangler in Automatic and what have you been working on lately except for the demo. I know about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong</em>: Well, first, thank you for having me and hosting this. Awesome to be here. I feel very honored to be with three on-time contributors. So super cool. At Automattic, I&#8217;ve been working on theme development, pretty solely focused on that for the last year. And my background is not in WordPress. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind of been an interesting journey to transition and learn about the ecosystem and really coming at a transitory time figuring out how do we kind of move into this new block-based paradigm? How do we make themes that work with the block editor really well and can hopefully unlock more creativity for just really great design. And I can tell you what sites again. Well, making new themes and figuring out how to do that with the latest version of Gutenberg, which turns out every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So the viewers follow Jeff Ong, he&#8217;s going to teach you how to do things with the Block Editor. And we will soon see a little demo of that. It&#8217;s what Daisy said, &#8220;What you did in five minutes, I taught a course on that in three hours.&#8221; So it&#8217;s going to be a little fast paced today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-strong-what-will-change-most-for-the-theme-developers-when-building-themes-for-full-site-editing-strong\">What will change most for the theme developers when building themes for full-site editing?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But before we head into media&#8217;s raised, I would like to ask each of you, so what do you think will change most for the theme developers when building themes? These are for agency building custom themes for the clients or for theme shops rolling out new themes to sell. Do you want to start, Tammie?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah. That&#8217;s interesting because I think perhaps it&#8217;s a change if you wanted to be a change. Because lots of this is an opt-in, as is the way. WordPress, the best way to opt-in. I go back to a lot of times that this is a freeing of things and I think it brings an opportunity that has pros and cons, ups and downs with opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But plug-ins themes no longer have to pretend that they&#8217;re plugins and they no longer have to be everything and have to be things that they weren&#8217;t intended to be in the first. So I think that that is a challenge in itself because there&#8217;s a certain way that you maybe thought you had to do things and now you don&#8217;t have to work around things. We often have to work around things in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you don&#8217;t have to work around it, it can feel a little bit peculiar, but once you realize you don&#8217;t have to do that, it&#8217;s actually really awesome. But you have to realize you don&#8217;t have to and that WordPress was getting in the way. I also think as a result there&#8217;s going to be a space for more creativity, and this can also be really to challenging because maybe you were limited to what you could do creativity wise because of just the confinements of the space and the confinements of what you could do before.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to open things again to a lot more people. And a lot more people who maybe didn&#8217;t have access to a theme developer with experience who knew the exact ins and outs of it. So I think that&#8217;s a challenge because new people in this space, new creativity. But honestly I think it&#8217;s a good thing. It&#8217;s just if you want to and you&#8217;re open to it and you can kind of explore those new ways, but I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a change that you have to make. I think that&#8217;s the thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. Thank you. Daisy, what do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>So I think I would agree with Tammie that the barrier of entry for a new theme designer. And I think that&#8217;s one of the key things is it&#8217;s bringing the design back to theming. Theming over time became very functional. We had a lot of theme companies that were trying to make their themes as flexible, powerful and feature-ful as possible to reach a wide variety of people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that we can see some opportunity for vertically oriented designs coming out where you have a theme that is geared towards a restaurant or geared towards, I don&#8217;t know, a salon or a certain kind of a business or even a personal site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that there&#8217;s a lot of opportunity to be able to have a lot of variety out there in the marketplace so that when someone asks you inevitable question, because this was probably the most common question when I was working for a thing company is which theme is best for this?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m doing this kind of a site, which themes should I use. And it could make it so, well, here are five that are really geared towards what you&#8217;re trying to do instead of, oh, you can use any of them. You just have to do all this work to get it to look bright.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Yeah. That&#8217;s a good point. Thank you. Jeff?.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Definitely, from a design perspective, it&#8217;s super exciting. I want to highlight maybe a little bit more from the development side. This seems like the biggest opportunity or clearest opportunity to ensure that your theme is integrated with the editor. That the things that you&#8217;re doing with the editor and your ability to customize it to control what presets and options are available there to the users of the theme, this is the theme [inaudible 00:12:27].</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a unifying kind of idea and single point of truth. Talking about theme.json and even just this whole concept of how do we bring the experience together. I think we have an opportunity to do that and that&#8217;s going to change even in some small level. Even if your theme.json cloud just as a few settings. You can take it slow like Tammie was saying. Incorporate parts of it because to me you have this new contract now that can really unify things and bring things together from a lot of disparate parts and pieces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Lots to think about. And I agree with all of you. I had this pleasure last year that I took over themes from agencies and they were so powerful and all the things that normally a plug-in will do, custom post types and rigid and all that. It&#8217;s all in one place and we won&#8217;t be able to change a theme at all. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now this is definitely going to make life a lot easier for site owners as well So lots to think about and listening to you is quite inspiring to kind of think, oh, well how many direction can my brain go now? But, Jeff, are you ready for your demo? I think it would be helpful for all the people here on the call to see what it&#8217;s all about and how it kind of gets started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yes. We have 10 minutes roughly. Yes. Can you see my screen? </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> We can see your screen. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-demo-configuring-the-block-editor-with-theme-json-file\">Demo: Configuring the block editor with theme.json file</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBwhHKKblhU&t=18s\">14.02</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: So we have a blank theme here and I just want to kind of go over some, not going to cover everything, but some of the key parts of that theme.json introduces and show how that impacts a blank theme and also the editor. So hopping over to my code editor. I have my theme.JSON here. This is a really basic, simple theme and nothing going on yet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In here I&#8217;m going to go ahead and the first thing I want to talk about are the settings of your theme.JSON. Settings are kind of what control or give you the ability to configure the editor and what kind of customization options are present to a user and the theme. The only thing I have right now is the layout, which we&#8217;ll get to in a second. But let&#8217;s say I want to add some color options here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously it would be done in the functions PHP. I have kind of a few sheets over here. Sorry. I need to hide these meeting control. I&#8217;m going to copy a color palette from this. I&#8217;m going to set a palette that&#8217;s going to become available to me in my theme. I go to edit the same post. In here I see my cornso, my orange, red, and color blue that&#8217;s become available to me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s pretty interesting about this is before you would have had to kind of go into functions at this whole palette and then also define the class name, something like this to actually apply those styles. Let&#8217;s say I want this heading to be orange, update it. Show it here. I get all this cool stuff for free. This class was generated for me by Gutenberg using this preset and that I have defined meeting controls defined here in my palette options.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another cool thing or interesting about the possibility here is within the same configuration. Let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m the theme designer. I have the option right now to change the color to kind of anything I want. The powerful thing about theme.json at this time is it can actually turn something like this off. I actually don&#8217;t want people or my users to be able to change anything, change the color palette.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s go ahead and reset this back here. Turned off custom colors within theme.json. And then back here you&#8217;ll see that option has disappeared. So inaccessible color combinations or just color combinations that you don&#8217;t want to be available. You can turn that off. This is just one of the options that are available. Color is just one of the options that you can customize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also take a look at something like typography. I think I can find some font sizes here. Refresh. I can see now that those presets were available, are now available to me. I can do the same thing again here too. Say I don&#8217;t actually want people to be able to change all sides here. As a designer I know it&#8217;s best and I don&#8217;t want people putting in random font sizes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So disable that and now only my presets are available too. Oh, by the way, this content is just kind of some standard block-based content. Again, I&#8217;m getting all of this kind of for free or for free in a way by just applying some preset values here. Well, I think the next thing that I wanted to cover is going into the last thing. I&#8217;ll cover it within the settings because you can actually change these per block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember we were looking at color before. I could add a color key to the paragraph block and actually say, just kidding. I want to allow you to be able to change the color of paragraph blocks. Just the paragraph blocks. I can open up the whole thing. So within here now I can see, oh, I can actually change just for paragraph blocks. I go up to my heading. This custom color is not available. This color option is not available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to I could also supply a custom palette. I&#8217;m not going to do that, but could say if you wanted a specific palette that&#8217;s just applied for paragraph blocks. That would be how you do it. So I think that&#8217;s it for settings. I&#8217;m going to go ahead and collapse this now and move on to the styles key of our theme.json. And now within here I can start to define some files.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Remember our colors from up here from the palette. I can go ahead and because I know that WordPress is generating CSS variables based on these palettes, I can go ahead and start to use those within the styles application of the style section of my theme.json. So with the preset color, put orange red. See what else do. These are going to apply at the top level. So this is going to apply to everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Say I only wanted, for instance, my headings to be&#8230; Let&#8217;s make this. Do the same thing in here and say, ah, I just want, actually, let&#8217;s just make my paragraph colors black. So, again, what I&#8217;ve done here is I&#8217;ve set my global kind of text color to this orange red was preset, which was provided by WordPress and generated here to the entire text. And then actually I can go in and target specific block, set the settings for that as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we are close. I just want to show, well, if you&#8217;re editing this, something that&#8217;s also probably going to happen and mess this up. It should throw some kind of an error here yet. Notice there when decoding theme.json. So that&#8217;ll let you know there&#8217;s something going on because it&#8217;s pretty easy tip something up here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that&#8217;s just a small note is we&#8217;ll likely encounter that if you&#8217;re configuring keys and nested objects trying to figure out how each of those apply. You pause here for a second. I guess the last thing I want to cover too is the concept of elements. So within here, any h2 that I have is going to be applied a specific style here. So I have the same because [inaudible 00:24:24] can appear outside of blocks or links, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are restricted to a specific set at the moment. So let&#8217;s just say text. So, again, because this is not actually rendered as a pocket and an element and that can appear anywhere. That&#8217;s something that I can target with this kind of top level elements select here. Everything else here you can target with the name of the block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is most of what I wanted to cover pretty fast, but again all of the settings that you can find here or that I&#8217;m going over, there&#8217;s way more than just color. There&#8217;s spacing, typography and all of that can be found in documentation that Birgit, I think she shared it here. So that I want to open it up. And I guess there are questions. If there are specific parts that anyone would want to go into in a little more detail. Happy to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Thank you, Jeff. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Thank you, Jeff. This was awesome. Do you want to just say something?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>Yeah. I just wanted to say that maybe we could just talk about layout real quick because I think that&#8217;s going to be a big one for 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. And I kind of skipped over. It was the first thing that was in here. Yes. Layout key is a way for you to quickly define the default, the width of your content within WordPress or within here. So if you see here, if I don&#8217;t define this layout, a lot of my content is just going to be full width by default. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can supply two values here. Content size, it&#8217;s just going to be the default width. You can also define, I think it&#8217;s, what is it? Wide size. Wide width. Nothing happened there because I hadn&#8217;t provided it. Maybe there&#8217;s a better way to show that with cover block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit Pauli-Haack: Nice. I like it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Pretty cool. You can, I mean, alignment coming together and within a unified system reliably layout content with starting here is pretty powerful stuff I&#8217;d say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. Awesome. So I shared in the chat window, if you haven&#8217;t seen it, the documentation link where you can read up about the theme.json as a whole. When you say, Daisy, that that&#8217;s the layout will be important for 5.8, which part of it would be, where does it come into play?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> So with 5.8 with the custom template functionality that&#8217;s coming where you can basically create a custom template for an entire page or a post that would cover your header as well as your content. If you need to have these setting set for the width, especially the content size for it but preferably also wide so that your site knows how wide it should be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otherwise you get kind of the facts that Jeff showed where it was the full width of the page. It didn&#8217;t have anything to contain it down to the width that you want. So for any theme that wants to use the template editor would benefit from having a theme.json file that even if it only has the one thing in it, it would be good way to take advantage of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. It&#8217;s an excellent tip. Thank you, Daisy. You heard it here first. So we already got some questions in our Q and A, but I just wanted to have one question for Jeff before. That&#8217;s my prerogative as a host, I get the first question. So if I understood it correctly, so until now, theme.json comes into play I had to create many different places or touch many different places to make a color palette work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I had to put it in my functions.php and then I also have to put it in my style sheet. Is [inaudible 00:30:04] that I don&#8217;t have to do this anymore, or do I still have to put it into my style sheet, or is it automatically created with when I put the color palette in the theme.json?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> It is wonderful question. It is automatically created. This is all that that style sheet looks like since this is one of the big very exciting aspects of a theme.json. It&#8217;s that it&#8217;s managing this for you. And then also I think more down the line by providing colors and styles in this way. And then also by applying the styles here you can guarantee that those blocks are going to integrate properly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like the styles for those blocks are going to be more closely tied and actually in how the block is implemented. So no more writing styles that are overwriting that we&#8217;re having to target specific nested blocks. And so there&#8217;s tons of complications to this and there&#8217;s a lot more room to mature and develop, but I think that&#8217;s one of the parts I&#8217;m most excited about. To your point, there&#8217;s one place now where I can define my palette and show how it should be applied. I don&#8217;t have to go into two different places to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Well, let&#8217;s go to the questions. Victor Kane, from the beginning of the show has already put them in and he&#8217;s particular interested in finding out about the workflow using them theme.json. So one is the best editing alternative for VS Code formatting, and then the second one was the possibility for exporting interactive selections to clipboard and code. I&#8217;m not quite sure I understand the question. Maybe you understand it, Jeff Daisy, Tammie.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Personally. So I think this is a personal choice. I&#8217;m going to start with an answer and then go to&#8230; I use VS Code, so I may not be able to give the right answer there. I would be curious to know what you don&#8217;t want in VS Code, and I think that that&#8217;s the thing. This opens up personal&#8230; I&#8217;m going to be really bad at reading the response in chat whilst talking. So I&#8217;m going to be a little bit pertinent and kind of speak first. I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;ll get back to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s your personal choice how you write and then you can kind of go back to it. So the thing that I did, this was my workflow, it has been my workflow so far, and I think this is the thing, we&#8217;re all finding our own new workflows with these new toys that we&#8217;re playing with. So what I&#8217;ve been doing is I&#8217;ve been using theme.json.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve actually been setting up variables using SAS that have been then pulling in root variables into my theme.json so that I can pull them through. That&#8217;s a weird way to do it. That&#8217;s strange, but the reason being, it means I can reuse and keep things separately. But I&#8217;m sure that everybody on this call has their own little workflows that they are kind of working from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> My approach to that was actually the opposite that I was using my theme.json to set all of my variables so that I didn&#8217;t need SAS, which I think for those that never quite got their head wrapped around preprocessed CSS, it might be a way to simplify things for those that prefer it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister: </em>I think it&#8217;s what you&#8217;re cozy with, right? And I think that&#8217;s the thing. This can adapt to what was your cozy blanket of coding, and you don&#8217;t have to lose that yet, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. So Victor commented on that. If I get the results, I want interactively with the global settings panel on the right-hand side of the editor, can I export that to a theme.json format?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>The answer is not right now. I think there&#8217;s discussion in the teams about maybe building it, but it hasn&#8217;t been the highest priority because everything needs to work first before we start working on an exporter. But there are other parts of that can be exported in that full site editing experience that can be exported. So I think it would be a natural progression to add the ability to do a theme.json export.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yes. Definitely there will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> From the very beginning, there were designs in global style. Sorry. The reason I know is that was one thing I did partake on. There was exporting. So I have a feeling if we all wanted to play some little happy bets, there will be exploiting at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. But if we all bet on the same thing, it&#8217;s not really bet, right? Victor, as always, you&#8217;re a little bit ahead of the time. So and from Jan Horna, from the Czech Republic, it&#8217;s very hot by now there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has two questions as a theme developer, one, is the theme.json supposed to include all the styling, formatting definitions and replaced the CSS style? And I think we&#8217;d take it one at a time. So we talked a little bit about it from my question, but would it replace? You could still do all those styling in the style sheets as you want, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> And I think there are some things that will remain in other styling, but you could use the variables that you set or the properties that you set in your theme.json in your CSS. So they can work together. But I don&#8217;t think that theme.json, at least right now, will not completely replace an entire site&#8217;s design, especially if you have a very complex design.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-meta-charset-utf-8-why-do-we-want-to-rewrite-css-in-json\">Why do we want to rewrite CSS in JSON</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. And this was one of my first questions and honestly, skepticism early on of the proposal around this, is CSS is great. Why do we want to rewrite CSS in JSON. And then it slowly, I mean, other people are obviously smarter than me understood this quickly. It&#8217;s not about rewriting all of CSS. There&#8217;s definitely going to be aspects of your site, especially if you have taking, like you&#8217;re saying, more complicated designs that will remain in CSS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is about creating, I think, more of the foundational elements and understanding how the blocks will interact with your styles and having that single point of contact, I think is most important. So I think for me, at least it&#8217;s more about the foundational elements that are going to be placed and managed this way than replacing your entirety of your styles. Because this great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like animations and transformation, and this is all really powerful stuff that I don&#8217;t imagine, really, at least in the super near future, having a big part of theme.json. To the question about, will you be able to save an export a theme.json from global styles? I think this is a really important thing to keep in mind is what I just showed you is kind of unnatural. I don&#8217;t imagine a future necessarily where theme developers are writing raw JSON.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s really, there&#8217;s not a great experience for it. It&#8217;s a configuration file. And so the more, to points that have already been raised, it&#8217;s about we&#8217;re in this phase now because we need to kind of identify and get it to work, and then we can kind of build an ecosystem around what would a really cool UI look like to generate one of these files? Is it native directly to global styles? How do we start to imagine those interfaces so the theme developers or theme designers can really get to the core of this experience too?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> All right. Well, thank you. Good point. You wanted to say something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister: </em>Yeah. I was just going to say over time, CSS has gained so much. So I didn&#8217;t know about anyone else, but I had a block.css file that was getting bigger and bigger of supporting blocks and doing things. And something I&#8217;ve noticed that I can do is throw that file away, and I couldn&#8217;t be happier because what I can do now is lean into these defaults. I&#8217;m still going to have some lines of CSS, the output by whatever, a preprocessor, whatever, my happy little whatever. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because everyone has got their own way and we should have our own way of doing it. But it&#8217;s a foundation, and it means that we&#8217;re not having to work around the editor or find different ways of doing it. I set up naturally a hack file for the editor out of habit. I haven&#8217;t filled it with anything yet in the latest theme I&#8217;ve been working on.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m delighted if I never fill that up with anything on the next theme, because it means that the new way we&#8217;re doing things hasn&#8217;t had me to work around that. I can just use the foundation and create a really awesome experience on top of it. And that&#8217;s what we should be doing. We should be working with the editor, not having to work around it, or using not important like it was going out of fashion to go over control of it. It was this awkward middle ground we were working in trying to make things fit that paradigm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> And I think that fits right into the next question from Jan Horna again, and he says so as a block theme developer, should I focus from a strategic point of view on theme.json block styles, or block patterns. In other words, how do I differentiate? It&#8217;s kind of a high-level question there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>D<em>aisy Olsen: </em>I would say all of the above. They&#8217;re all important things. And your block styles are part of theme.json, I would say. But block patterns are really a powerful partner to the theme.json, that you can create building blocks for a site where you&#8217;ve got some really amazing very specific designed elements that could be used for different things on a site. So if you&#8217;re creating a commercial application that&#8217;s going to go out to a wide audience, they can be more generic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you have a client and you&#8217;re working as a freelancer or in an agency where you have a site that needs to have access to these things that they&#8217;re going to use more than once, patterns are a fantastic way to do that, where most of the work is done for them. They don&#8217;t have to reconfigure everything from the ground up every time they want to create something similar to what they&#8217;ve done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-what-happens-when-you-update-the-color-palette-will-saved-blocks-have-the-new-colors\">What happens when you update the color palette? Will saved blocks have the new colors?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you. And Spencer McCormick in the chat had a question. So what happens when you update the color palette or similar, for example, if you have a primary and secondary colors, when you update and change the palette colors, will saved blocks have the new colors? That&#8217;s an interesting question. Thank you, Spenser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> I can answer that to some extent. If you think of your palette as named colors, if you give the different hex code to the same name, it should apply to the site. But if you give it a new name, then that&#8217;s a new element, and it won&#8217;t apply to anything that already had an old name attached to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> There is a hefty discussion related to this question on the naming of colors in the way that Gutenberg wants to supply a default palette or a default set of named colors so that you could reliably&#8230; What we&#8217;re seeing I think is that I think patterns have been wanting to rely on specific colors across kind of, so you can guarantee oh, when corn flour shows up it&#8217;s always going to be corn flour. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always going to be available. There&#8217;s a lot of complication and nuance around it. But if, I think today, to answer your question, like Daisy is saying, today, if I were to supply a value or a named value here and then change it or take it out of my palette, then that would break the experience or it would no longer be applied to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s part of the challenge, how do we reliably solve for that? How do we give theme office the tools to figure that out. But now if they set a custom color, if you set a custom color on an element or a block, then that will remain because it&#8217;s a specific X value, but the class names will go away though, if they&#8217;re supplied by the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So great discussions. And I&#8217;m probably going to share, and if it&#8217;s one issue where that discuss the theme team every week kind of shares all the things that are discussed and that need input from the community or other theme developers on their make blog. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is definitely a place to go to chime in and we&#8217;ll find all the discussions that are happening. And then chime in in the ones that you find important and that you are worried about. So Tim Bowen has the question, how does the theme.json handle responsive sizes for font sizes especially. Responsive sizes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>By default, I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> You&#8217;ve stomped the panelists. Yes, we did it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I mean, you can use not just pixel values for your fonts, so-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> That&#8217;s what I was going to say. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tammie Lister: &#8230; that helps. And I think it&#8217;s a work in progress. So things like responsive and breakpoints. But the now answer is you don&#8217;t have to just use pixels. And Jeff just gave a great leak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Je<em>ff Ong: </em>I just dropped the issue in that has not seen a lot of activity around it, but the idea of media. So the first part of your question on font sizes, there are ways of calculating this where they&#8217;re not pixel values tied to specific viewports. You could supply a calculated value, for example, in your small&#8230; that is based on a viewport size. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s kind of a paradigm shift or design paradigm shift of getting away from you must be 12 pixels under below 600 pixel viewport width, to more of are we okay with kind of a fluid typography kind of system? That being said, there are instances where you need media queries, and that is not currently&#8230; I don&#8217;t know how actively that&#8217;s being worked on right now. But a wonderful thing open to contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> So Patty has a comment and a question after that, Patty O&#8217;Hara, I most often develop custom themes for clients and hand them off for the clients to update the content. And playing around with new tools, I&#8217;m excited to start using them, but don&#8217;t want to give access to global standards to anyone with admin access. Will the granularity of permissions changes so that I can block access to changing fonts and colors from within the admin?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I think this amazing thing happens in where also Jeff showed some of the control you can do. So in the demo, there was some control that you can do. But my process is a history of configurability and being able to do that be it in code, or be it in a plugin. But I honestly think we need to be a little bit cautious. This is my personal opinion here, and we need to maybe embrace allowing people to do styling. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can set boundaries, you can set branding boundaries, you can set pallets, you can set topography. But we need to move away a little bit from having such pixel fixated control in that sense and think about safely within boundaries, expression of these tools. And that people can create really amazing things, and you can maintain branding that way, and it can empower someone.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These themes are becoming style guides, and that&#8217;s something that is known in the corporate world and used within that space as well. It&#8217;s a term, but it&#8217;s kind of democratizing design in that sense in giving people all these tools to play with, and I think it&#8217;s a huge change in the way that we&#8217;ve done things, but I think it&#8217;s really, really important and really, really empowering to the people that are using our themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>That&#8217;s a good advocacy for set it free. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> But you&#8217;re allowed to have boundaries. I think you can set it free, but be comfortable about some boundaries. I think sometimes when we say set it free, it can be scary because we don&#8217;t say you&#8217;re allowed to have some boundaries, but with pallets and with these style guides, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re saying. You&#8217;re saying I&#8217;m making these good decisions for you and you can choose from this platform of good decisions. And that&#8217;s kind of awesome. I think,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack: </em>Yeah. I like the plea for block patterns that Daisy just a couple of minutes had that block patterns also give you the possibility or the option to actually provide different facets of how a section can be organized or styled within the style design system that you build with the block add on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that there is a lot of creativity that will come from that as well. So Tim Bowen is brave and contemplating, is it safe to use the theme.json now for a project launching in August? Would we just activate the Gutenberg plugin and add JSON file? Or is there more to it? I would love to move away from our functions in Editor.js method probably as soon as possible. So what would we say to Tim?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> The theme is not a block theme, as in it doesn&#8217;t use HTML templates, then I probably wouldn&#8217;t put the Gutenberg plugin on a production website, unless you are ready to deal with unexpected things happening. But placing your theme.json file in your classic theme on the 5.8 beta or release candidate that will be coming, I would start testing there and see if the things that you&#8217;re putting in your theme.json file work with 5.8 on a classic theme. That&#8217;d be my suggestion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> I think if it&#8217;s launching in August, that means 5.8 should be out. She tries to check her mental calendar. So I think tests. I, personally, am okay. I would consider it if it was going into a site, but I would also want to know how many users were using it, what their levels was, what they were doing, what they were going to create, and how they were going to do it. So it&#8217;s a&#8230; this is not legal advice. I feel that there should be [inaudible 00:50:36] advice that I can be. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Don&#8217;t try this at home. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> But by then, 5.8 should be out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Yeah. 5.8 comes out July 20th, that&#8217;s at least the schedule for that. So we ran out of questions right now one the Q and A sessions here. Well, you&#8217;re welcome, Tim. Good luck with that, and let us know. Is there more to the setting it up besides just activating the plugin or adding the JSON file. Well, back to kind of using it and editing. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When there are already themes available in the theme repository that use the full set up for full site editing and use all the template parts and templates with the blocks, and header blocks, and photo blocks, and all that. But I&#8217;m not quite sure of that yet. Be careful about the using the Gutenberg plugin in production. It always has a few hiccups there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it wasn&#8217;t the first time ever that I retreated to the last version when I had one and had to wait till one, two, or three point releases to come out. So I&#8217;m hesitant to say do it in production. Test it as much as possible. So I have a lot of things on my screen, but not the right thing. Here, so it is. Oh, Ryan, we are pretty good time wise. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I don&#8217;t have an additional&#8230; So, when we say how to get started, what was the first thing most difficult part for you for learning, or was there a mind shift until it clicked? Just to kind of get away from a fear of learning something new, and was there something when you go back ages on the theme.json thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Tammie Lister: </em></strong>So for me, it was realizing it wasn&#8217;t as hard as I maybe mentally thought it was. It was just the same with learning anything. You always think it&#8217;s going to be super hard, or at least with me, I read like dev doc and I&#8217;m like&#8230; My brain makes that noise. And then I just letting my theme be lighter. Letting it take the weight of that, giving up control, which as someone that&#8217;s maybe a bit of an old themer, giving up control of things, that&#8217;s an interesting process to go through. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really important embracing those foundations. And when you do, there&#8217;s that mind shift of creating in the editor. That was the moment that&#8230; And I&#8217;m still going through the process. I think it&#8217;s a process, and it&#8217;s a process as these tools are evolving. We&#8217;re talking about be gentle, they&#8217;re in production. These tools are still evolving and working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are using these tools now before it&#8217;s released, then you&#8217;re going to hit bugs and report them. But that&#8217;s the thing. This theme.json also&#8230; the moment I kind of, the Jenga box, the blocks fell in my brain was I stopped seeing it as global stars. And I knew it wasn&#8217;t just global stars, but I felt it wasn&#8217;t just global stars and this felt like it could be the backbone of my theme, and it felt like it wasn&#8217;t everything in my theme, but it felt like it could be the backbone, is the best way I can describe it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I could hang my theme from it. And we&#8217;ve hung our theme from functions.php wrongly, I think. So it was just that change from PHP to doing it all in the editor and creating and seeing that JSON. It just was free, and it&#8217;s more in line with how things are made outside WordPress, which I think is delightful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Any comments from you that you want to add, Daisy?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen: </em>So when I first started working with a theme.json file, I found that I had to&#8230; So there&#8217;s a whole section called styles, and I had to realign my thinking about what that meant, because what it&#8217;s saying is there are style settings in your blocks or for your site level depending on how it&#8217;s being applied, and what you&#8217;re doing is configuring the defaults for it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I think of the theme.json file as a default file, then it helped me frame it so that I&#8217;m not necessarily replacing my CSS depending on&#8230; I mean, I&#8217;m letting theme.json do the heavy lifting, kind of like Tammie said, but then I can take it further if I feel like I need to, or I want to. So I like thinking of it as a configuration file or a defaults file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> That&#8217;s a good point. Jeff, do you have any stories how I came about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: It&#8217;s been really helpful to pair on it with people, to work on a theme with someone. I think if my team at Automattic. It&#8217;s a very culture of collaboration, and if you have the opportunity to say, &#8220;I&#8217;m having trouble with this. Would you want to work on this?&#8221; With someone like that, because this definitely can be a head bashing kind of why is this not being applied? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I literally just wrote color green. Why is it not green? It can be so frustrating dealing with that. So to have someone just to look at your code and be like &#8220;Oh, you missed a comma or actually you need an extra key there&#8221; is really, really helpful for something like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Oh yeah. So well, I think we&#8217;re coming to the end of our show. This has been very interesting and inspiring. So thank you all so much. And for those who want to dive into at a guided kind of testing session, Anne McCarthy, who, as you might know, runs the Full Site Editing Outreach program, she&#8217;s about to post the eighth call for testing, and it will all be about the theme.json file.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So as soon as it&#8217;s out, I will share a link in the show notes. And of course, also if you subscribed to our Gutenberg Times newsletter, you will definitely be informed about that. So at this point, I only have two more questions for our panelists. So do you have any announcements that you couldn&#8217;t get out before and you want the people to keep in mind? And if people want to get in touch with you, what would be the best way. Tammie, you want to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Tammie Lister:</em> Yeah. So I&#8217;m comatose in all the things. I&#8217;m pretty easy to find in a good way. And I love chatting to people. So please do. I think my thing to say would be remember all of what happening now you can help shape. Just because we&#8217;ve sat here talking about it doesn&#8217;t mean we know anything more than you? It just means we&#8217;ve poked it and we&#8217;ve played around with the code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do that. Start exploring it. And it&#8217;s a lot more accessible than it ever was. It&#8217;s starting to be more accessible. There&#8217;s more documentation than there ever was coming out. And if you care about what happens with themes or you ever cared about what happens to themes, and maybe you could have that reignited, start to join the conversation. And I guess my final point would be, I think my hope is to see this experimentation come back to themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we forgot about that a little bit and we need to have some fun again in these. We used to have so much fun in WordPress themes, and I look forward to not just themes to have a purpose, but just themes that are art, themes that are just wacky experiments, and start enjoying theming and make some art. I&#8217;m really excited to see what things people create and use them just for one day even. That&#8217;d be amazing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So Jeff, anything you want to have people keep in mind, and how to get in contact with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Jeff Ong:</em> Yeah. Contact at J-F-F-N-G. And I guess keeping in mind, I&#8217;m just building on the last thing Tammie said, perhaps find a way to have fun with it and get curious about it, and try it. There&#8217;s really to me, a fundamental tendance of learning about something or you just have, how do I get curious about this thing? How do I play with it and have fun? And that&#8217;s going to be the most important thing to keep in at the center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Thank you, Jeff, and thank you so much for the audio work on the demo. Daisy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Daisy Olsen:</em> I&#8217;m Daisy Olsen on most things, Olsen with an E, and I would say that as far as what you can do as the next step if you&#8217;re interested in learning more about this, is go to&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure that Birgit has a link to this somewhere, the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments/\">theme experiments repository on GitHub</a> in the WordPress space has things that other people have done or are working on. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I love to see examples of something in action to help me learn more about it and to see what other people have done. So I would say go check out something.json files in there and see what people have come up with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack:</em> Awesome. Thank you so much. So big thank you to Daisy, Jeff, and Tammie to come today and make your time. A big thank you also for the viewers with all your great questions. I think we got a great array of it. And if you have more questions, you can always send them to me via email to <a href=\"mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com\">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>, and I&#8217;ll get you the answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the recording of the show will be available in a few minutes on our YouTube channel. And I&#8217;ll share all the links then also in the video description. And within a few days, we will have also a transcript that we will publish on the Gutenbergtimes.com. So be well, good-bye, and good luck. That was fun. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jeff Ong: Thank you, everyone.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"Gutenberg Times: Block-based Template Editor is coming to WordPress 5.8 and a new Widget Editor – Weekend Edition #174\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=18214\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/block-based-template-editor-is-coming-to-wordpress-5-8-and-a-new-widget-editor-weekend-edition-174/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14651:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots happening in the larger WordPress space!

He followed <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/05/12/help-test-the-widgets-editor-for-wordpress-5-8/\">Andrei Draganescu call for testing</a> and logged his experience. To test for backwards compatibility for your existing widgets, you can first create some with the new widget editor disabled using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/\">Classic Widget plugin,</a> and then deactivate the plugins and try to manage and edit the widgets with the block-based editor. You have only a month to make sure your sites won&#8217;t run into trouble.

The trigger: I wrote about <a href=\"https://web.dev/measure/\">Core Web Vitals</a> for a different project and used the Gutenberg Times as a test project, using <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse\">Google&#8217;s Lighthouse</a> via an incognito browser window. The desktop version performed very well, all circles in the green range, but the mobile version really crawled over the Internet, ranking in the low 40ties. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://searchengineland.com/google-postpones-page-experience-update-rollout-347862\">Google announced</a> earlier this year that they start rolling out new page experience update in this month, and start using Web Vitals as another ranking factor for organic search results. I also noticed that GT had a very high number of visitors via the desktop, but not many on mobile, which I found odd. Now I know why. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/introducing-eksell/\">Anders Noren&#8217;s Eksell</a> is our new theme. I love the typography, the clean design. and its graphics. I just started exploring it. Nothing gets things done faster than working on the live site. 😊</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The content mostly converted well, except there are no widget areas, so I would need to add the widget via the Legacy widget block. It was hit-and-miss. This exercise turned out to be a great test for the new block-based Widget screen, which will come to a WordPress instance near you in the 5.8 release on July 20th, 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the discussions, I learned that the Gutenberg team is leaning towards an opt-out rather than an opt-in implementation. Testing sites with this week&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/06/wordpress-5-8-beta-1/\">WordPress 5.8 Beta 1</a>, is definitely recommended. If you don&#8217;t have time to test all the site you are working on, rest easy, there is a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-widgets/\">Classic Widget plugin</a> you can install to keep the old Widget screen.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What else happened this week? <strong>WordCamp Europe! </strong>It was a great virtual conference. Kudos to the organizers, speakers, sponsors and attendees! If you missed it, you can watch the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaYQGYDpXpU4A17kxN-AgJQ\">recordings on YouTube.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The video with the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/06/gutenberg-highlights/\"><strong>Gutenberg Highlights</strong></a> is available for those of use who missed the Conversation with Matt Mullenweg. <strong>Matias Ventura</strong> wrote: &#8220;The video is wonderfully narrated by&nbsp;<strong>Beatriz Fialho</strong>, and it was a great opportunity to celebrate all the incredible work that contributors are doing around the globe to improve the editing and customization experience of WordPress&#8221;.

You can use the official  <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">Beta Tester Plugin </a>to test this version. If you haven&#8217;t used it before, the Core Team share information and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/beta-testing/\">instructions in their handbook</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can read more about the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-8/\">development cycle of WordPress 5.8 here</a>. Feature Freeze for this upcoming version was May 25. We are right now in the beta phase of the cycle. It will be used for testing and to fix bugs. That is to last until June 29, 2021, when the first Release Candidate will be released.  That&#8217;s also the deadline for Dev Notes and Field Guide. It also comes with a hard-string freeze. That&#8217;s the moment the Polyglots team starts with translations. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Features and updates for WordPress 5.8</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of <strong>DevNotes</strong>, the Gutenberg team tracks their progress on the  DevNotes via <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32365\">this GitHub issue.</a>  You can get a head start on <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/gziolo/cbea77500316a243e445d509ced3c231\"><strong>&#8220;Block API Enhancements&#8221;</strong></a> by <strong>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</strong> or <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32365#issuecomment-853726663\">&#8220;Contextual patterns for easier creation and block transformations&#8221;</a> </strong>by <strong>Nik Tsekouras</strong> before they are published on the Make Core blog. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> posted about other <strong>Block Editor Enhancements:</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/05/20/core-editor-improvement-contextual-patterns-for-easier-creation/\">Contextual patterns for easier creation</a>  and </li><li>How to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/09/core-editor-improvement-improve-your-workflow-with-list-view/\">improve your workflow with List View</a>, the former Block Navigator feature. </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>On the WordPress News Blog, you found earlier: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/05/coloring-your-images-with-duotone-filters/\"><strong>Coloring Your Images With Duotone Filters</strong></a> by <strong>Alex Lende</strong>.

Grzegorz Ziolkowski joined me as co-host with episode 41. In February 2021, we celebrated the first 10,000 downloads. Now four months later, we passed the 26,000 mark of downloads. For such a narrow niche show, these are mind-boggling numbers.  It is very humbling.  We are very grateful for our faithful listeners! Thank you all very much. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Grzegorz Ziolkowski</strong> is back from vacation, and we recorded episode 45. We covered Gutenberg 10.7 and 10.8 releases, WordCamp Europe and WordPress 5.8.  It will be published later this weekend. The similar t-shirts? Mere coincidence! </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<h2>Gutenberg 10.8</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Gutenberg 10.8</strong> was released this week. It had quite a few enhancements, and a ton of bug fixes and underlying code change for quality and tooling. <strong>Sandip Mondal</strong> work on his first release and published the release notes: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/06/10/whats-new-in-gutenberg-10-8-9-june/\"><strong>What’s new in Gutenberg 10.8?

In his post <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2021/06/08/initial-patterns-for-the-wordpress-org-patterns-directory/\"><strong>Initial Patterns for the WordPress.org Patterns Directory</strong></a>, he explained the details of the submission process.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Justin Tadlock</strong>, a big fan of block patterns, wrote about the invitation on the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/open-invitation-to-contribute-to-the-wordpress-block-pattern-directory\">WordPress Tavern </a>and showcased some of his creations. <strong>Ana Segota, </strong>co-founder of <a href=\"https://www.anarieldesign.com/\">Anariel Design</a> shared <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Ana_Segota/status/1402688373421187080\">her submissions via Twitter.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22%5BType%5D+Pattern+Submission%22+is%3Aclosed\"><strong>review the list of submissions on GitHub</strong></a> and learn from the comments on by the design team.

What a great start! </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Full Site Editing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Europe 2021, the Panelist <strong>Danielle Zarcaro, Grzegorz Ziółkowski, Koen Van den Wijngaert and Milana Cap</strong> discussed Full Site editing and what it means for the broader WordPress community. <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordcamp-europe-full-site-editing-panel-discussion/\"><strong>We have the recording and the transcript for you</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p>We added the Blockbase Theme to the list of<a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/themes-for-full-site-editing-and-getting-ready-for-wordpress-5-8-weekend-edition-172/#fsethemes\"> available FSE themes</a> last week. <strong>Kjell Reigstad</strong> published <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2021/06/07/using-blockbase-for-a-theme-experiment/\">Using Blockbase for a theme&nbsp;experiment</a> on the ThemeShaper blog and take you on a journey on creating a child theme of Blockbase. He wrote &#8220;Overall, I found that the benefit to using Blockbase was peace of mind.

It certainly sets the base numbers to see what will happen until December. These are the numbers to watch changing in the next half year, and it will answer the original questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>57%</strong>&nbsp;of theme shops&nbsp;<strong>feature their Gutenberg compatibility</strong>.</li><li>Only&nbsp;<strong>17%</strong>&nbsp;of theme shops&nbsp;<strong>offer custom Gutenberg blocks</strong>.</li><li><strong>3%</strong>&nbsp;of theme shops&nbsp;<strong>provide block patterns</strong>.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The team also talked to 22 theme shops about their intentions regards full-site editing.  <a href=\"https://wpmarmite.com/en/fse-study/\">You need to read the article to learn more</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Fränk Klein</strong> at WPDeveloper Courses, released his new course: <a href=\"https://wpdevelopment.courses/courses/building-block-based-themes/\"><strong>Building Block-Based Themes</strong></a>.

I&#8217;m Danielle. I&#8217;m from the US. I am the head of paperback web development. We build custom WordPress websites and maintain them, and maintain existing websites, and all that that comes with. We just launched overnightwebsite.com. So that&#8217;s mostly what I deal with is the old and the new of WordPress. So it&#8217;s the whole range.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> Thanks, Danielle. Let&#8217;s go with Koen.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><img /><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert</em></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Hey, hi, there. Is this thing on? Hey, Good evening. I&#8217;m Koen. I&#8217;m a WordCamp and meetup organizer from Belgium. I run my own company called NEOK IT, where I provide software consultancy, partly around WordPress. I&#8217;ve been working with WordPress for a few years now. I like to learn things, as well as challenge myself while doing it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for a while now, I&#8217;ve been casually contributing to Gutenberg, as a way of giving back and mostly getting more accustomed to the ins and outs of the project. So that&#8217;s me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-rounded\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1047874472403845121/ckX4uiBZ_400x400.jpg?resize=203%2C203&ssl=1\" alt=\"Image\" width=\"203\" height=\"203\" /><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowsk</em></div>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowski:</em> It looks like it&#8217;s me now. So my name is Grzegorz Ziółkowski. I live in Oleśnica, Poland, and I work at Automatic, where I spend all time contributing to the WordPress core. My main focus is Gutenberg. I was helping to merge changes from the plugin, Gutenberg plugin to the WordPress core for the upcoming WordPress 5.8 release, which won&#8217;t contain all the necessary pieces of the full site editing. However, there is a lot of new goodies coming that will be ready to use on the site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lesley Molecke:</em> Excellent. So Moncho and I have come up with a bunch of questions for you. They go from really basic, and then they work up and get more and more exciting and interesting. So we&#8217;re going to start with the first one, which is actually, this is my question, because I don&#8217;t know the answer to it yet and hopefully you will educate me. What is full site editing and where did it come from?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-what-is-full-site-editing-and-where-did-it-come-from-nbsp\">What is full site editing and where did it come from?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Maybe if I can start, maybe the best thing to say at first is that full site editing is not just a big monolithic heap of a big function. It&#8217;s better to think of it as a collection of a lot of features that come with Gutenberg, as part of the second phase of the Gutenberg roadmap. Maybe someone else can pitch in now, so I don&#8217;t do a monologue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowski:</em> If you don&#8217;t take a bigger picture, so full site editing is part of the Gutenberg project, there are four phases. And we are reaching this year, the end of phase two. The first one was introducing the building blocks for editing content. Now, we will be editing a full canvas of the sites. And the next two phases are collaborative editing. So to let people collaborate when they are changing websites or writing content. And the fourth one is multilingual support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> What everyone is waiting for, I believe. That&#8217;s going to be a big one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-what-problem-does-full-site-editing-solve\">What problem does Full-Site Editing solve?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> Anything else? Anything else? Because one of the things inside of Lesley&#8217;s question is, what problem does it solve? Which is, I think, very interesting. What do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> I think that the problem it&#8217;s trying to solve is to give the user one unique workflow to edit everything. Because at this moment, you have post, you have page, and you go to block editor. Or if you are not brave enough, you&#8217;re still using classic editor and you edit your content there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then you want to change your logo, then you have to go to customizer. But then you have some theme options. And it depends on theme from theme, what will you edit and where? I believe the idea is to release end user from need to know everything about the theme, you just go there and you just edit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you want to edit footer, and you&#8217;re on the post and you&#8217;re editing post, and then you realize the menu is not correct, you edit menu. You don&#8217;t need to know, because nobody cares is it customizer or whatever? People care to know where it is. And it&#8217;s a good thing that you can see how it looks on the front end, which I think was the initial idea for Gutenberg. But who knows? Maybe I&#8217;m wrong.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s a huge problem that will be fixed, and solved with full site editing. For us who are building websites, I know that for every website, I have to create a ton of tutorials and everything, to show clients how to use it. And this will solve all that. So we will be out of job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> I also like to think that it brings a lot of power and more freedom and flexibility to end users of a website. Because in the traditional way of doing things, there&#8217;s a few ways one can have a WordPress website. He can have an agency, have a website built for him. Or he could be using some sort of a theme builder, or he could have installed a theme from the theme directory or maybe it&#8217;s even a custom theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now end users are able to have so much more power about editing templates, and editing all sorts of aspects of their website. I think that&#8217;s really exciting to look forward to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Danielle Zarcaro:</em> I think it solves a couple of problems, to add to that. It takes away some of the ambiguity around how to edit each individual thing. So WordPress&#8217;s whole thing is to democratize publishing. There were areas of the websites that were just not available to edit to anyone who doesn&#8217;t know code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s the ease of use gap that came about, that you can&#8217;t edit the 404 page, you can&#8217;t edit the header or footer, unless an option is available. Is the theme using the site logo that you upload in WordPress, or you&#8217;re going to upload the image and then theme isn&#8217;t going to show it. It gets rid of those, however the theme developer decided to do it that day, and it streamlines a lot of that process to do some expected behavior to make it easier for anyone to hop into a site and edit it, and it democratizes publishing on a whole new level.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> That&#8217;s a nice way of saying it. Yes. Because right now there&#8217;s this huge fragmented world of all different ways of themes that came up with our own way of editing site features and headers and customizing things. But there&#8217;s no real standard way of doing that. So it just makes it harder to step out of that particular ecosystem, I think. I&#8217;m looking forward to the standardized way of doing theming in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron</em>: Grzegorz, I think you had something. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowski:</em> I wanted to add some more to it. Because I think it&#8217;s important to note that it&#8217;s not only about unifying everything, but it&#8217;s also to giving the power to users to change those little bits that annoy them, like the color of the header, or the font size.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before, you would have, or either learn CSS or learn HTML just to edit that. But now you will have tools that will allow that, and you won&#8217;t have to call your site administrator to do a simple change. So maybe you could tell that, remove the job from those people who maintain those sites, but on the other hand, they will have more time to work on expanding their offering and improving their own products or services, just to use the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is something that sounds scary, but on the other hand, it opens a lot of possibilities. Because the idea of blocks also gives you the power that you can create your own blocks that you can use in several websites, and give additional functionality out of the box for your customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-what-happens-to-websites-that-are-live-in-production-when-word-press-5-8-is-released\">What happens to websites that are live (in production) when WordPress 5.8 is released?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> So regarding that this is something new, something is going to happen from 5.8, as far as I know, what happens to the WordPress websites that are already live and in production? Must they be rebuilt in order to use full site editing? Or they&#8217;re going to work in the way they are?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> They have to be rebuilt completely. It will crash. No, it won&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert</em>: It will just crash when you update.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> No, it won&#8217;t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lesley Molecke:</em>That&#8217;s big news.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Oh, we were not supposed to say that, sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> No, they will not be crashed, they will not have to be rebuilt completely. As you all know, WordPress always build in mind with what is already out there, not to crash anything. And in 5.8, not everything will get in. So if I&#8217;m wrong, please correct me, but I think that in 5.8, you will have to install a Gutenberg plugin to actually use full site editing. So not everything will be there, but it will be foundation for the next releases when everything else will come in.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But still, we will have some nice things coming in and nothing will break. You can go part by part and rebuilding it and adapting for a complete editing experience.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> Thanks, Milana. Anything to add ?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Maybe Grzegorz can do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowski:</em> You can go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Okay, but you can just&#8230; Well, some of the full site editing features will be added to 5.8, I think, but Grzegorz will probably be able to say which one exactly. I&#8217;m hearing feedback.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> An echo. There is an echo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> So it&#8217;s not some monolithic feature, like we said before, but it&#8217;s more like a collection of features and they won&#8217;t be turned off all at once by default, by just upgrading to WordPress 5.8. You do need to have a full site editing team to enable all features, but some of them will also be available for non-block based themes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like the template editor blocks, the site logo, the tagline, the query blocks, posts, posts related blocks, like post title, post [inaudible 00:14:45], they will all be made available in the post editor. And as well as that, I think it was also possible to also not edit, but with add new templates to a normal theme and edit those in the template editor. It&#8217;s pretty awesome.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowski:</em> So the first step is to allow people to change, use the block-based paradigm on a single page. So think about that, about previously you would have to create a PHP file to change a single page view. And now you will be able to do that to through UI, and that will create an override that you would be able to delete later. But as a user, so it&#8217;s more like empowering people who have access to the sites, rather that&#8217;s a feature for the team designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s one thing. And everything like that is optional, so there will be a flag to disable that. So site owners or theme authors we will say that, &#8220;I don&#8217;t want that,&#8221; and they can remove that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one big change is that not necessarily related to full site editing, but is somehow in the same area is the widget editor, which will be&#8230; I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the final decision, but it will be depending on the feedback from the testing, either an opt-in or opt-out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the idea would be that you will be able to use the same blogs you use in your content to use also in site, when you would previously use widgets. So that&#8217;s a nice change. If you have your own custom blocks, you would be able to put there as well, which will open those new possibilities, and also somehow unify the interface.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as you could hear, there is a lot of new blocks coming. But it&#8217;s just addition, it&#8217;s not something that you have to use. It&#8217;s just there if you want to try them out, that will be perfect time to do that after 5.8 is out. And there is a-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> That will be released tomorrow, by the way. So if you want to test it, please do so. It&#8217;s by a lot of users that can test and provide feedback on the new update that we can improve upon those things, and decide what can be added and what should be skipped. So go install it tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lesley Molecke:</em>Yes, we should acknowledge that, that everyone here is actually working really hard right now to create the new release, while also attending WordCamp Europe and being here on this panel and contributing on track too, and y&#8217;all are everywhere. Thank you, thank you, thank you for your time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-what-does-full-site-editing-change-for-the-various-word-press-stakeholders\">What does Full Site Editing change for the various WordPress stakeholders </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My next question has to do with stakeholders. So obviously, a big change like this to WordPress has multiple stakeholder groups. It has the end users, the users of WordPress websites down the road. It has the editors of WordPress websites. It has the companies who build themes and the companies who build plugins, and the people who contribute, all of these different groups.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m interested in talking about the theme creators who currently primarily rely on offering block patterns with their own header and footer and sidebar management. So how does that work with full site editing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Danielle Zarcaro:</em> Well, it works the same way. You can offer whatever you want. I think it&#8217;s a misconception that by giving the users the ability to do what they want means that they&#8217;ll be able to do anything they want. If you are someone like me who&#8217;s creating custom sites, you can actually more easy put options and make it so that you don&#8217;t have to install a whole extra plugin to add a couple of extra options. You reserve that for the bigger projects that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s up to the theme creators, if they&#8217;re creating a theme on a wider scale, instead of just an individual client, that&#8217;s up to them to decide how they want it to work. They just opt into stuff, they add stuff, they add their custom options, but it&#8217;s all working within the same ecosystem, and we&#8217;re all speaking the same language now instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you don&#8217;t want to make it so that your header and your footer and your sidebars are manageable in the block editor or in full site editing, then I guess you don&#8217;t have to. You can hard code whatever you want, you can do that now, you don&#8217;t have to make any options available.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then at some point, you&#8217;re going to start to fall behind, in terms of what you&#8217;re able to do. So it&#8217;s going to work the same way, just with more possibilities. That&#8217;s how I go about looking at it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> You&#8217;ll be able to turn off or on, or even tweak some of the configuration options just by providing a single JSON file for those things. But also, I like to think that with full site editing, a theme developer or theme designer can benefit from a more solid foundation that is standardized and optimized for things like accessibility, usability and performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That way more of their time and energy can be spent into building things that actually add value to their customers, all the while benefiting from the existing full site editing features and even tweaking them to their liking. So that&#8217;s a big plus, I think. So they don&#8217;t have to go and reinvent the wheel every time they build a new website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> There is something related to the last major change we saw in WordPress, when Gutenberg appears, when Gutenberg finally was born in 5.0. And now you can see that there is a plugin that is the old editor. And at this moment, we this kind of legacy, we can call it legacy, but it&#8217;s still available there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-why\">Why will Full-Site Editing be in Core and not a plugin?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>My question is about why there are things that can sit in the core, and a different one can be set as a plugin? For example, why put the full site editing in the core when it is something that the majority of users at this moment don&#8217;t know? And we hope all of them are going to use it, but as everything that comes new in WordPress, there is always a time for getting used to it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what do you think is the main reason full site editing is in the core and not, for example, in a plugin and people can choose if they want it or not?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> I think that now that we have Gutenberg in core, and full site editing is obviously expansion of what we were using in core by now, I think it would be silly not to have it in core and have it as a plugin, when you can use&#8230; This is just a foundation to put all the blocks that you already have. So it&#8217;s not like the structure that you still don&#8217;t have, you have. There is Gutenberg and now you will just expand it to the whole website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there is benefit in having everything standardized, especially for people who are using themes from our repository. So when you switch theme, you have all those available, things to edit, you know where it is, and you have all the blocks available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> Makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> So that&#8217;s a huge benefit. I love that theme in wordpress.org is insisting on idea that people will change themes, and they cannot lose anything. I love that idea. I think this will really help having that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you have custom themes, and people have different ways of editing right now the header, the footer, or they don&#8217;t have it at all, so you&#8217;re afraid to change the theme. But with full site editing, you will have all that available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, as far as not knowing how to use it goes, we didn&#8217;t know many things, how to use. And the thing that we really need right now is, here comes my pitch, documentation. So we really, really need to document everything good, because when you don&#8217;t have documentation, people don&#8217;t know how to use it and then they don&#8217;t interact with it enough. They don&#8217;t find bugs, they don&#8217;t contribute. They don&#8217;t think ideas how to expand it, and you don&#8217;t have contributors, and there is no cycle for open source. So first, we need to do a good documentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We did fail a bit with Gutenberg getting in, and we can still feel it. We can still feel developers who are frustrated and don&#8217;t know how to work with it and how to build on that. I&#8217;m asking everyone to come and help. While doing documentation, you will actually learn how to do it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not afraid of new things. I don&#8217;t think anyone should be afraid, especially because this is not a really new thing, like Gutenberg was a new thing. We didn&#8217;t know what it was. Now we know, full site editing is what we already know, it&#8217;s new, but expanded, so it&#8217;s easier to learn. And if we do enough work, and we are doing&#8230; people make WordPress themes are doing great job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just mentioning few, Anne is doing the testing, great job, and Carolina even have a website for full site editing where you can read everything. So it&#8217;s doing better, and we can learn and there are resources, so there&#8217;s no need to be afraid of it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> And if I&#8217;m not mistaken, there&#8217;s even seven milestones added to the full site editing milestones. It&#8217;s called gradual adoption. So that it focuses solely on making sure that full site editing features are being adopted better and more gradual. And that work is being put into actually making sure that the documentation is on par, and that the dev notes are up to date, and all of that kind of thing. So that&#8217;s also important. That&#8217;s also part of the work that&#8217;s now being done after the feature freeze for the 5.8 features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Danielle Zarcaro:</em> I think from my perspective, as someone who&#8217;s working with it and working with people, no one&#8217;s going to use it if you make it optional. People are going to do what they&#8217;re going to do, if you let them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think WordPress itself has never, it&#8217;s been very transparent about where it&#8217;s going. We&#8217;ve all been able to use Gutenberg for years now. We&#8217;ve been able to install the plugin, and then we&#8217;ve been able to use the block editor in core for years now. So it&#8217;s like we&#8217;ve had this getting used to period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we&#8217;re just going in the direction that we said we&#8217;d go in, and people can still find ways to go backwards. They can still install the classic plugin for sites that need it, they can install the classic plugin for certain things. They cannot enable the block editor for custom post types. There&#8217;s all kinds of stuff that you can do to counteract some of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But like I referenced before, and I&#8217;ve talked a lot about this in the past, at some point, you have to embrace the tool that you&#8217;re using. So you&#8217;re either going to embrace the fact that we&#8217;re all working towards the same goal, or you&#8217;re working against it and basically forking your own version and working on your own, which is fine. But then you can&#8217;t offer the latest stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s up to you as a developer to, on some level, work with things, and meet WordPress where it is. You have to give up. WordPress is open source. You have to allow yourself to go with the tide a little bit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you have new users who come into WordPress, who are installing things, they&#8217;re not going to know that there was an old WordPress. They&#8217;re not going to know that, oh, I have to install this other plugin to enable all of these awesome features. You have to think forward. So you have to allow these new users to start installing it, and use all the cool latest stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If someone wants to go backwards for a bit, then they can put the work in to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowski: </em>It&#8217;s also worth mentioning that the full site editing, it&#8217;s soon to be included in the core, it&#8217;s always something that we wanted to have. It&#8217;s not something that came, because there was the 5.0 release and the block editor. It&#8217;s the other way around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we took the smallest step possible to enable people to start using this block paradigm, start learning UI. We got a lot of feedback. And if you look at the iterations that worked, how the editor looked two and a half years ago and how it looks now, it&#8217;s a completely different product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also the way, how we people started thinking about building content with blocks is different. It&#8217;s not longer, building small custom blocks, but rather combining a lot of existing blocks into block patterns, into having UIs, having ways to change a big portion of the page with solutions. Like now it&#8217;s coming to the query block that allows you to switch the list of blog posts will be displayed on the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are constantly trying to make it easier for users to provide the infrastructure, also for plugin authors, for theme authors, so they can build upon that, and have the unified experience. So people, once they learn how to write a post, they will know how to change the template of the page, because it&#8217;s exactly the same paradigm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s even in the same UI interface. You just go from one page to another, without the page reload. Everything can happen, you can go back, you can revisit how it looks when you compose everything together. It&#8217;s no longer you need to go to the preview of the page and see another tab to see, oh, it looks good, but now something broke outside of the post content. I need to go find customizers and go to this template, or call the theme author on the support and change that for me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a huge project, and has so many layers on top of that. We want to bring as much as possible, I would say, what makes sense to most of the users, but not all of them. Because there is always room for extenders to build their own solutions on top of that, and give this unique perspective and look and feel for the customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6-w\">What will be the role of existing page builders?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lesley Molecke:</em> I feel like we&#8217;re tiptoeing closer and closer to this question. I&#8217;m just going to ask it, just get it out there on the table. What do you all feel is the big role for the online page builders, the Divi, the Elementor, these big guys, taking into account that we&#8217;re moving into full site editing, block patterns, all of these things that are being built into WordPress core? What is the role of these page builders that so many of us use?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Danielle Zarcaro:</em> I think that&#8217;s up to them. I think ultimately, they were there to push the envelope. They were there to bring us to where we currently are. I think without them, we might not have had this extra push. Maybe it would have taken a few more years to put all this into core. These builders saw this hole and filled it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And ultimately, they&#8217;re going to have a different UI anyway. So they&#8217;re going to do have their fan base, they&#8217;re going to have their whatever preference to editing things, maybe certain things are dragging and dropping. Whatever they make available, they&#8217;re going to extend WordPress. So that&#8217;s up to them to decide how they&#8217;re going to go about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they&#8217;re all already currently working with the block editor, all the major ones anyway are. If they&#8217;re concerned at all about future proofing themselves, they&#8217;ve already looked into how to integrate themselves with the block editor. I think it&#8217;s only going to enhance everything to see how they go about integrating themselves into the new ecosystem.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love, as a developer, I love the way Oxygen goes about it, where you can build stuff, and then go and edit it in Gutenberg. So that&#8217;s a really cool take on it. And so it&#8217;s just a new way to innovate, and they&#8217;re going to have their place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s cool that we now have these established things. We have these people to look to, to see where are the new holes in WordPress? Where can we go from here? And they&#8217;re going to continue to just push the envelope. I love the diversity that&#8217;s out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you talk about builders, there&#8217;s at least four that come to mind and that&#8217;s awesome. And I hope that it stays that way and grows. And that&#8217;s only going to help us. And so hopefully, it&#8217;ll take away some of that, Divi does this way and Elementor does this way. So some things are going to hopefully become uniform, and then they&#8217;ll branch out in other ways.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Exactly. Because now, there&#8217;s a few big ones indeed, and they all seem to have their own ecosystem surrounding them, which is okay, because as you said, they all implement and provide their own stream of users to the WordPress platform. So it&#8217;s definitely interesting to look at, and observe how they will interact with WordPress and Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know most of them already have some sort of a way to either include a new template view or something as a block, or even toggle between Gutenberg and their own editor. But the thing I&#8217;m actually quite looking forward to is whether or not they will start using the new default way of doing things. So that they can actually merit from how it is now going to be supposed to be done, and add on top of that their own set of features and new value-adding stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like the cadence theme, for example, is doing. In my eyes, it&#8217;s quite a nice way of implementing Gutenberg the right way. I&#8217;m very interested to see how they will be going to implement full site editing things in the near future, because now it&#8217;s all in the customizer, of course. So, interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7-what-is-going-to-happen-with-the-rest-of-the-open-source-solutions-like-joomla-drupal\">What is going to happen with the rest of the open-source solutions like Joomla, Drupal?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> We were talking about how full site editing can affect the own WordPress ecosystem, talking about for example, what happens with the builders, builders like Divi, Elementor, et cetera. But what do you think, taking account you are developers, designers, you are on the technical side, contributors, what do you think is going to happen with the rest of the open source solutions like Joomla, Drupal? How do you think it&#8217;s going to affect? So it&#8217;s going to make WordPress better than the rest, it&#8217;s going to be a real advantage in front of the rest, like Wix, like the other ones, not only in the open source reality, but outside WordPress? What do you think is going to happen with full site editing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap: </em>They will all take Gutenberg. Drupal already do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> But Drupal also has a [crosstalk 00:37:15]. But there&#8217;s not like this CMS is better than the other one. They all serve different purposes. And it&#8217;s like using the right tool for the right job. And having more competition in the game is pretty good actually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the biggest reason that we, as WordPress, have the biggest market share to date in the CMS market is because of the low threshold to start building websites. And that&#8217;s partly thanks to all of those theme builders. I think it&#8217;s important to reach out and make sure that we all keep using WordPress and not just fork off their own version of WordPress, because it&#8217;s open source, they can do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we all collaborate, we can build pretty nice things, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> I think we already saw this many times in history, but let&#8217;s just take a look at Internet Explorer 6. It was so bad that we got this good Chrome and Firefox. And it was so difficult to create posts for some people in WordPress, that we got page builders. So this is happening. There is always this kind of competition between WordPress and Joomla and Drupal.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the truth is, they all have their share. Ours is a little bigger than theirs, but they will continue to exist, and I hope they will push, they will invent something new. And then we will be jealous, and we will do something better, because that&#8217;s how it works. Human mind compares. So that&#8217;s what we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m proud that 12 years ago I have selected WordPress and now it&#8217;s 40%. I think I&#8217;m smart, because I did that. But I don&#8217;t like just one way of doing things. I like things messing up. I like people inventing new things. That makes us all better and everything makes better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really looking forward to see what other CMSs will do, but also what will page builders do. I have never used page builder, as someone who builds website and some of you uses website. I cannot say anything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I&#8217;m seeing in our WordPress Serbia Facebook group, I&#8217;m seeing people asking questions about it. I know what they are doing and how, and I really hope to see they invent something insane, so we will have to push Gutenberg again and just pushing forward.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Even better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Danielle Zarcaro:</em> I think it&#8217;s going to blur the line a little bit. Because I just recently had to go into a Wix site and it is no longer Wix or Weebly. It is Wix or Webflow. Webflow popped up as an in between to Weebly and the GoDaddy builder and WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it blurs the line a little bit, where you can now visually edit things and you can now edit those parts, like I said, the 404. All these other things, you can just do now. And so I think it blurs the line and WordPress can now fit into more categories as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe it&#8217;s not a Squarespace, which is a template machine that you stick a bunch of stuff in and it&#8217;s easy, but it does open it up to a whole nother market. Instead of just, oh, you got to have somebody on your side, it now opens the door for more people. And then now they&#8217;re ready to grow, and now they come to you and are familiar with WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s the three or four other markets that&#8217;ll pop up as well. So it blurs a little bit and makes it a little more accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowski:</em> There&#8217;s also one thing that I&#8217;m looking forward to, is the blog patterns directory, which should enable a quicker creation of websites, instead of going, changing everything yourself. If you don&#8217;t have, like me, skills for designing, you just pick something that someone crafted very carefully. And maybe pay some fee for that and have unique experience for all the use cases you have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s no longer you need to use one theme, and hope that it has all the solutions you need. Instead, you can combine from different sources and build the best experience you need. So that&#8217;s one thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing that I&#8217;m looking forward to is how I&#8217;m seeing the growth of headless. It&#8217;s getting a lot of attention at the conferences in the WordPress community. And that interaction with full site editing, I&#8217;m looking forward how that will evolve. Because at the moment, if you want to use headless solutions you need to build from scratch the front end side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, if you combine that with what Gutenberg can produce and reach that, that will open a new set of possibilities. And that will bring big companies looking at WordPress, because now they will be able to build completely custom solutions, and also use whatever WordPress provides in its core, rather treating it as a source of the content only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> I&#8217;m glad to read that question.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lesley Molecke:</em> Koen, you have one final thing to add, before we sign off?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> I was going to say that one obstacle might be that a lot of back end developers have mostly skills in writing PHP and stuff. But most of the new features, you really do benefit more if you have a JavaScript back end. I think we should also focus on helping those developers transition into more and more adopting JavaScript and active development to develop even better new solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap: </em>And documentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Most importantly, of course.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lesley Molecke: </em>Yes. Well, thank you, thank you, thank you all for this really interesting conversation. I now know more about full site editing than I do before, thanks to you. But also, I think our audience does as well, which is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And again, thank you for taking the time to join us, even though you&#8217;re also so, so busy working on the new release, and working on this massive change to WordPress. We&#8217;re really grateful to you and your time. Enjoy the rest of the conference. We will see you later and thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will you be heading over to the Q&amp;A room to talk with the audience? Does that sound like a familiar thing to you? All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> We can, if there are questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> There will be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lesley Molecke:</em> People can also make meetings with you and see you in other rooms and things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>José Ramón Padron:</em> There will be more content related full site editing during WordCamp Europe, in each day, I think, or also in the number two track. So this is not the last time we are going to talk about full site editing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing is to say thank you for accepting our invitation, more or less in the last minute. Thank you. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Lesley Molecke:</em>Thank you all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Milana Cap:</em> Thank you, bye.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Grzegorz Ziółkowski:</em> Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Koen Van den Wijngaert:</em> Thank you.

This year, the organizer decide to sprinkle contributor event into the rest of the schedule and have for all three days, a mix between techtalk, business talks and contributor presentation and discussions. There are quite a few events around the Block editor, Full-site-editing and block-based themes. <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordcamp-europe-2021-starts-monday/\">I compiled a list for you.</a> And just because I am so focused on Gutenberg, doesn&#8217;t mean you have to. 😎 <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/schedule/\">Check out the schedule</a> and <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/registration/\">get your tickets now</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, it will be the last virtual conference and we will see each other at an in-person WordCamp Europe in 2022. I am still hoping for Porto, Portugal.  At this state of withdrawal from meeting WordPress friends in person, it doesn&#8217;t matter where it will take place, thought.

This post is a summary of the sixth call for testing for the experimental FSE outreach program, which also was translated into Italian to reach more of the non-English audience. Earlier calls were also translated into Japanese.

What will happen with their templates when the site-owner decides to change the overall theme of their site? There is still plenty to be figured out. <strong><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/31971\">How edited block templates are linked to themes</a></strong> is topic of the discussion on GitHub. The Gutenberg team would appreciate some thoughts from folks familiar with these APIs (theme mods, performance, database).</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kjell Reigstad</strong> posted again acomprehensive list of issues and discussions regarding block-based themes and Full-Site Editing: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/06/04/gutenberg-themes-week-of-may-31-2021/\"><strong>Gutenberg + Themes: Week of May 31, 2021</strong></a>.

Enterprise WordPress is definitely heading down that route. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>June 24 &#8211; 26, 2021</strong><br /><strong><a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Cochabama</a></strong> (Colombia) </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>July 17 + 18th, 2021</strong><br /><strong><a href=\"https://santaclarita.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Santa Clarita</a></strong><br />Calls for speakers ends TODAY! </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>July 23, 2021</strong><br /><a href=\"https://www.wordfest.live/\"><strong>WordFest Live </strong></a>&#8211; <em>The&nbsp;</em>festival of WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A<strong>ugust 6 + 7, 2021</strong><br /><a href=\"https://nicaragua.wordcamp.org/2021/\"><strong>WordCamp Nicaragua</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>September 21 + 22, 2021</strong><br /><a href=\"https://2021.wpcampus.org/\"><strong>WPCampus 2021 Online</strong></a><br />&#8220;A free online conference for web accessibility and WordPress in higher education.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>On the<a href=\"https://wpcalendar.io/online/\"> <strong>Calendar for WordPress Online Events</strong> </a>you can browse a list of the upcoming WordPress Meetups, around the world, including WooCommerce, Elementor, Divi Builder and Beaver Builder meetups. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-center\"><strong>Don&#8217;t want to miss the next Weekend Edition? </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<form class=\"wp-block-newsletterglue-form ngl-form ngl-portrait\" action=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/\" method=\"post\"><div class=\"ngl-form-container\"><div class=\"ngl-form-field\"><label class=\"ngl-form-label\" for=\"ngl_email\">Type in your Email address to subscribe.</label><div class=\"ngl-form-input\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"ngl-form-input-text\" name=\"ngl_email\" id=\"ngl_email\" /></div></div><button class=\"ngl-form-button\">Subscribe</button><p class=\"ngl-form-text\">We hate spam, too and won&#8217;t give your email address to anyone except Mailchimp to send out our Weekend Edition</p></div><div class=\"ngl-message-overlay\"><div class=\"ngl-message-svg-wrap\"></div><div class=\"ngl-message-overlay-text\">Thanks for subscribing.</div></div><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ngl_list_id\" id=\"ngl_list_id\" value=\"26f81bd8ae\" /><input type=\"hidden\" name=\"ngl_double_optin\" id=\"ngl_double_optin\" value=\"yes\" /></form>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n\n<p>Featured Image: Photo by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@xavi_cabrera?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Xavi Cabrera</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unsplash.com/s/photos/lego?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"Gutenberg Times: WordCamp Europe 2021 starts Monday\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=17964\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordcamp-europe-2021-starts-monday/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6936:\"<p>WordCamp Europe 2021 will be one of the largest virtual WordCamps again and the schedule has some great talks for every WordPress users, developers, site builders, theme designers, DIY site owners and content creators. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We looked through the schedule and spotted very forward-looking Gutenberg related talks, workshops and discussions.

In terms of value, it depends on who you are:<br />User: empowerment to customize what you want to your liking without needing to dive into code.<br />Themer/developer: focus less on coding thanks to various design tools and more on creating a compelling experience with your theme.<br />Agency: greater control and consistency over what you offer clients including things like setting custom branding colors or locking down various aspects of the site such as typography settings.<br />When you see or feel this value depends on who you are, how early you adopt features, and when stable features land in Core. Thanks to FSE being a collection of features, some independent and some interdependent, there’s wonderful room to ship what’s stable.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1622843371957\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What is going to happen to WordPress themes and what kinds of pathways are being created?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">In the long run, it should make theme development much easier and simpler with design tools ready to tap into allowing theme authors to focus less on coding and functions and more on design expression and aesthetics. Because Full Site Editing requires a block based theme, this makes themes extremely important to get right! As a result, lots of pathways are being created including the ability to use theme blocks in a classic theme, exploring how to use the customizer and site editor as part of a “universal theme”, unlocking the ability to create a new block template in a classic theme, allowing classic themes to adopt the block widget editor, and more.<br />Key: Themes are a key part of the FSE experience, lots of work is being done to allow for a breadth of options going forward, and we need feedback from theme authors to make the transition easier. </p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1622843448534\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What about page builders/site builders?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">FSE is being built in a way that site builders, if they choose to, can build on top of what’s being created. Overall though, FSE is being built partially so people don’t get locked into one site builder over another. While the goals shared between FSE and site builders are similar in terms of empowering users and give better tools to customize a site, the main difference is that we are developing tools that work for users, themers, and hopefully also page builders by expanding how WordPress uses blocks as a whole. Since Core has to strike a nice balance, it’s expected that future plugins will play a role here in exposing more/less depending on user needs.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1622843480900\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">How will restricting access to these Full-site editing features work?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">This will depend on who is asking the question (a user, a theme author, a developer, etc) but some of the GitHub issues referenced above should help. For users, I’d focus on the fact that they would either need to seek out a block theme to use or their current theme would need to ship specific updates. For a themer/developer, I’d share that there will be various options to opt in and out of this work (<a href=\"https://href.li/?https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27814#issuecomment-823921386\">for example with creating block templates</a>). Upcoming <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/32365\">5.8 dev notes</a> should address this for any new features.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1622843499287\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Will upgrading to 5.8 cause FSE to take over my site like the Core Editor did in 5.0?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">No. 5.8 is focused on giving tools to extenders first and foremost before more user facing changes are launched going forward and integrated into themes. In terms of user facing features, you can expect to see</p> </div> </div>\n\n\n\n<p><em><a href=\"https://nomad.blog/2021/06/02/so-you-want-to-talk-about-full-site-editing/\">Anne McCarthy published this post on her personal blog</a> and gave us permission to republish it here as well.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignfull is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-top is-image-fill has-background\"><a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/8816229019893/WN_gyOVb1h4S4iO_UZi1GMQaA\"><img /></a><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"><strong><a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/8816229019893/WN_gyOVb1h4S4iO_UZi1GMQaA\">Join us for our next Live Q &amp; A</a> </strong><br />on June 24, 2021 at 11am EDT / 15:00 UTC</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Theme.json for Theme Authors or building themes for full-site editing in WordPress.</strong><br /><strong>Host</strong>: Birgit Pauli-Haack<br /><strong>Panel:</strong>&nbsp;Daily Olson, Tammie Lister and Jeff Ong           <span class=\"has-inline-color\"><strong><a href=\"https://us02web.zoom.us/webinar/register/8816229019893/WN_gyOVb1h4S4iO_UZi1GMQaA\">Register Now</a></strong></span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Anne McCarthy\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"Gutenberg Times: Why WordPress Agencies Are Embracing Gutenberg – Help Test WordPress 5.8  – Weekend Edition #171\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=17922\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/why-wordpress-agencies-are-embracing-gutenberg-help-test-wordpress-5-8-weekend-edition-171/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12753:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memorial Day is a federal holiday, honoring the men and women who died while serving in the U.S. military.

It&#8217;s still about eight weeks away, but there is a lot of work in front of us.  We are coming up to Feature Freeze on May 25, 2021. The Gutenberg team has a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/releases/tag/v10.7.0-rc.1\">release candidate for 10.7</a>, the last version of the plugin, that will make it into WordPress Core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>How can you help?

We are looking for more contributors to not only get through the latest task list but also update some documentation pages with 5.6 and 5.7 changes. If you have a few hours, and want to take a deep dive into the block-editor features, let me know   by joining the #docs channel or DM me on the Make Slack. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wishing everyone lots of patience.  We are still in a pandemic, and all good things take time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yours 💕,<br />Birgit</p>\n\n\n\n<p>PS: Did a deep dive into the <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/data\">wp.data package</a> to learn more about state management for the block-editor.

Now the Herb went beyond the template editor bits that are coming to WordPress 5.8. He demonstrated the full Site Editor, which isn&#8217;t slated to come to WordPress until 5.9 or even 6.0. To follow along you would need a block-based theme and the latest Gutenberg version (for now 10.6.2). After a tour around the Site Editor, Herb Miller, shared with the audience how he built a block-based theme. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinapoena\">Carolina Nymark</a></strong> published here <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/armando/\"><strong>full-site editing theme &#8220;Armando&#8221;</strong></a> in the theme directory on WordPress.org.

The <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/themes/theme-json/\"><strong>Documentation</strong></a> is available in the Gutenberg Handbook. <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/riadbenguella\">Riad Benguella</a></strong> wrote an <a href=\"https://riad.blog/2021/05/05/introduction-to-wordpresss-global-styles-and-global-settings/\"><strong>Introduction to WordPress’s Global Styles and Global Settings</strong></a> to get you started on the new era of Theme development in WordPress. <em>(Yes, I shared this before.

Justin Tadlock took <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/anariel-design-launches-naledi-a-block-based-wordpress-theme\">the theme for a spin</a>. Once the theme is available at WordPress.org, it will be the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/tags/full-site-editing/\">sixth theme for full-site editing.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>When will we see yours? </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pollyplummer\">Sarah Gooding</a> </strong>has the story of  <strong><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/blocksy-theme-expands-free-starter-site-collection-plans-to-create-new-suite-of-blocks\">Blocksy Theme Expands Free Starter Site Collection, Plans to Create New Suite of Blocks</a>.</strong> Blocksy embraced the block-editor wholeheartedly and grew it&#8217;s business rapidly, it seems. They also integrate well with the blocks by Stackable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plugins for the Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Benjamin Intal</strong>, of <a href=\"https://wpstackable.com\">Stackable </a>was this week&#8217;s guest of the WP Tavern Jukebox podcast, and he discussed with <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpbuilds\">Nathan Wrigley</a></strong> the <strong><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/3-benjamin-intal-on-why-hes-betting-his-business-on-blocks\">Why He’s Betting His Business on Blocks</a>.</strong> Intal and his team were an early adopter of the Block-editor and publish their plugin already in 2018 before the block-editor made it into WordPress Core. Since them Stackable has been an often recommended plugin for content creators, and it has grown quite a bit in features and reach. It&#8217;s certainly worth a listening, considering another wave of creativity and opportunities is coming to WordPress. This time for themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alexandra Yap </strong>of Stackable recently posted the <a href=\"https://wpstackable.com/blog/introducing-dynamic-content/\"><strong>Introducing Dynamic Content.</strong> </a>They wrote: &#8220;We’ve received a huge number of requests to display content from ACF’s custom fields in Stackable blocks, and now you can! <a href=\"https://wpstackable.com/blog/stackable-integrates-with-acf/\">Most ACF field types are supported</a> as well as ACF Options Pages.&#8221;. They also <a href=\"https://wpstackable.com/blog/create-dynamic-content-in-stackable-with-toolset/\">integrate with Toolset</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock\">Justin Tadlock</a></strong> reviewed a newly published pricing block and found <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/you-might-not-need-that-block\"><strong>You Might Not Need That Block</strong></a>. &#8220;With WordPress’s base blocks and a decent theme, many custom solutions are possible via patterns.&#8221;, he wrote, and he went ahead and recreated a three column pricing table with the core blocks and different themes, Twenty-Twenty, Eksell, and a full-site editing theme, too. I strongly agree with Tadlock that block patterns would provide an easier path. I can see that plugins like Easy-digital downloads, Woo Commerce and other ecommerce plugins would offer such patterns together with their Gutenberg blocks extensions to get store owners up and running quickly. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/pootlepress\">Jamie Marsland</a> </strong>shared the <a href=\"https://www.pootlepress.com/2021/05/10-big-updates-to-our-woocommerce-gutenberg-plugins/\"><strong>10 Big Updates to PootlePress WooCommerce Gutenberg plugins</strong></a> Storefront Blocks and WooBuilder Blocks. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"events\">Upcoming WordPress Events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>June 7 &#8211; 9th, 2021</strong><br /><strong><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Europe</a></strong><br />A virtual event and contributor day. <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/call-for-sponsors/\">Call for sponsors is open.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>🎉</strong>  Gutenberg Times is a media partner of WordCamp Europe 2021 </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>June 20 &#8211; 26</strong><br /><strong><a href=\"https://japan.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Japan</a></strong><br /><em>The schedule has been posted.

Gutenberg feature freeze is practically on May 19th when the Gutenberg 10.7 RC candidate is released. After those dates,  only bug fixes will make it into the first Beta release, scheduled for June 7, 2021. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep all the dates straight I consult the full <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-8/\">WordPress 5.8 Development Cycle</a> page. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Calls for Testing</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/andraganescu/\">Andre Draganescu</a></strong> posted <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/05/12/help-test-the-widgets-editor-for-wordpress-5-8/\"><strong>Help Test the Widgets Editor for WordPress 5.8</strong></a> with test instructions for three scenarios any user could test</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Migrating from classic widgets</li><li>Adding blocks next to widgets</li><li>Opting out of the new widgets screen with the new plugin</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>He also urges Theme and Plugin developers <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/tree/trunk/docs/how-to-guides/widgets\">to read the available documentation</a> and suggests to</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Test upgrading classic widgets to blocks.</li><li>Test enabling and disabling theme support</li><li>Test 3rd party widgets compatibility.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a></strong>  in her post<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/05/12/fse-program-testing-call-6-stick-the-landing-pages/\"><strong> &#8220;Stick the Landing (pages)&#8221;</strong></a> ( 😁 nice pun!)* composed a real-life scenario for the various tests of the template editor and use it for landing pages. This goes to the heart of the new feature slated to be introduced to WordPress users with WordPress 5.8. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The instructions come with a very nice demo of the template editor in a <em>silent movie</em>. Just follow the mouse pointer. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"toolbelt-video-wrapper\"></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\">(* I had to look it up: Stick the landing &#8211; is an expression that comes from gymnastic or other athletic routine when the athlete <em>lands firmly and confidently on their feet. </em>Or an aviator executes a <em>flawless landing</em>. &#8211; all part of the service&#8230; )</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gutenberg 10.6</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg 10.6 was released and comes with a ton of create features!

We are less than four weeks and two more Gutenberg plugin releases away from feature freeze.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Goals of Gutenberg updates for the next major WordPress release</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last two or three weeks, I listened to the interviews and Q &amp; As. I learned the team working on the block-editor pieces for this release has two goals: </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, to release enough stable tools for developers and designers to start using aspects of Full-site editing in their themes, via theme.json and hybrid constructs for classic themes.  The hope is that by the time the rest of Full-Site-Editing interface is released to the users in December 2020, there are plenty of block-based themes and block patterns available from the community of extenders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, to introduce the new <em>page template feature</em>. It&#8217;s a new way to use the block editor to create and modify page templates for landing pages. This will be the first time in WordPress that a content creator or site owner would be able to change headers and footer for single pages. This takes a bit of a switch in the publishing / producing mindset. Gutenberg developers are hoping here for plenty of user feedback to make sure that the new blocks and in their new context, the user-facing elements are clear enough to handle in this smaller scope of a single page before the expanded version of Full-site editing is released in December 2021, that allows users to create and modify site-wide templates, template parts and to build new themes. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block-Editor Features to come to  WordPress 5.8</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/15/full-site-editing-go-no-go-april-14-2021/\">Go/NoGo meeting and decision</a>, technical lead <strong>Hector Prieto </strong>published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/20/full-site-editing-go-no-go-next-steps/\"><strong>Full Site Editing Go/No Go: Next steps</strong></a> with more details around the full scope of the block editor pieces for WordPress 5.8 </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Gutenberg plugin releases 9.9 &#8211; 10.7</li><li>First version of theme.json for theme builders of block-based themes. </li><li>Theme Blocks (Query, Navigation, Site information)</li><li>Template Editing with the post editor</li><li>Widget Editor and block widgets in Customizer</li><li>Persistent List view in the post editor</li><li>Duotone (Image filter) block supports</li><li>Gallery block refactor</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>In the post you&#8217;ll find links to issues and pr for even more details. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Increased Buzz about Full-Site Editing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the WordPress News site, there were a few posts regarding the block-editor and Full-Site Editing. Using the WordPress News space to published more frequently about the ongoing development and ideas is one part of the stronger communication outreach planned for this new feature release. The more intense communication about Full-site editing from the core team is a direct result from the feedback from the WordPress community after the first  Gutenberg release in 2018. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/04/curious-about-full-site-editing/\"><strong>Curious about Full-Site Editing</strong></a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden\"><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy</strong></a>.

It is a great first article to share with WordPress users and co-workers that hear about Full-site editing for the first time. The resources share are good starting place to catch up. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The second article wasn&#8217;t about Full-site editing, so much but about the Gutenberg. <strong>Anne McCarthy </strong>posted <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/04/become-an-early-adopter-with-the-gutenberg-plugin/\"><strong>Become an Early Adopter With the Gutenberg Plugin</strong></a>, and tackled the various terms, we have mostly used as synonyms between Gutenberg, block-editor etc. Also, a good place to start, if someone likes to dive deeper into Gutenberg beyond the WordPress Core implementation. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The latest article in the WordPress News section, is the tutorial <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2021/04/getting-started-with-the-figma-wordpress-design-library/\"><strong>Getting Started with the Figma WordPress Design Library</strong></a> by <strong>James Koster.</strong> Learn how to quickly create design prototypes for WordPress UI in <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/\">Figma</a>, a collaborative interface design tool.

The episode comes with a transcript. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Gutenberg Release and Block editor updates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/23/core-editor-improvement-refining-the-block-toolbar/\"><strong>Core Editor Improvement: Refining the Block Toolbar</strong></a>, Anne McCarthy elaborates on the refinement and standardization implemented for the Block Toolbar with the goal to simplify the hierarchy of the block, to make it more predictable what goes where.&nbsp;Below graphic is part of the newly updated <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/how-to-guides/designers/block-design/#group-block-toolbar-controls-with-related-items\">Best practices for Block Design</a> page of the developer handbook. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>This week Gutenberg 10.5 was released and in short succession v 10.5.1, v 10.5.2 and v 10.5.3. to fixing regression bugs. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ajitbohra\"><strong>Ajit Bohra </strong></a>wrote about <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/04/30/whats-new-in-gutenberg-10-5-28-april/\"><strong>What’s New In Gutenberg 10.5</strong></a>. 15 new block patterns made it into the release and template editing is now also available for classic themes. For the latter, exercise optimistic caution should you use the Gutenberg plugin in productions. Many, many more changes came to the block-editor. <em>Grzegorz Ziolkowski and I recorded our take on it for the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast\">Gutenberg Changelog</a> podcast yesterday, and it should come to your favorite pod catcher over the weekend. </em></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/justintadlock\"><strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> </a>shared his experience in his post <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-10-5-embeds-pdfs-adds-verse-block-color-options-and-introduces-new-patterns\"><strong>Gutenberg 10.5 Embeds PDFs, Adds Verse Block Color Options, and Introduces New Patterns</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index 2021&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index-2020/\">The index 2020 is here</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Block Pattern Directory</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of Block Patterns, <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ryelle\">Kelly Choyce-Dwan</a></strong> posted the <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2021/04/28/block-pattern-directory-update/\">Block Pattern Directory Update</a> </strong>from the Meta team. She invites you to follow along on the site that is a red-hat zone for now, but it already gives you a good idea on how it is going to work. Check it out on<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/meta/2021/04/28/block-pattern-directory-update/\"> wordpress.org/patterns</a>. The patterns are arranged in squares in five categories: <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern-categories/buttons/\">Buttons</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern-categories/columns/\">Columns</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern-categories/gallery/\">Gallery</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern-categories/header/\">Header</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern-categories/text/\">Text</a>. You click on the square to see a details page with a larger representation and a button “Copy Pattern” or add them to your &#8216;Favorites&#8217;. Although, Kelly wrote that the copy button doesn’t work yet, I quickly tested it, and you can just paste it into your next post, even if you are not in code edit mode.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The meta team is now working on the process for WP.org users to submit patterns into the directory, and the accompanying automated evaluation and moderation feature. WordPress users will be able to find block patterns right from the block editor inserter and add them directly to their post or pages. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, the core block patterns will be removed from Gutenberg and made available through the Pattern directory only.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Testing Full-Site editing: The outreach program</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Full-Site Editing Outreach program is in full swing.. Anne McCarthy and dozens of people contribute to WordPress by testing the new feature. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/page-template-editor-for-wordpress-5-8-videos-and-plugins-weekend-edition-166/\">Since the last Weekend Edition</a>, there were quite a few updates coming out of the program. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>🗓️ <strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/04/22/upcoming-fse-outreach-program-schedule/\">Upcoming FSE Outreach Program Schedule</a> &#8211; Synch your calendars! </strong>😂</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For anyone who wants to learn more about the program, Anne McCarthy was a guest on the WordPress Jukebox podcast last month. <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/wpbuilds\">Nathan Wrigley</a>,</strong> host of the revived WPTavern podcast <strong>Jukebox</strong>, discussed with her <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/2-anne-mccarthy-on-how-full-site-editing-will-impact-wordpress\"><strong>How Full Site Editing Will Impact WordPress</strong></a> and why the program and its participants are an essential part for a successful implementation of the new features. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/04/20/fse-program-building-a-restaurant-header-summary/\"><strong>Building a Restaurant Header Summary</strong></a> you can read a curated list of outcomes and finding from the 4th Call for Testing. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In this week&#8217;s <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/04/29/hallway-hangout-discussion-on-full-site-editing-issues-prs-designs-29-april/\"><strong>Hallway Hangout: Discussion on Full Site Editing Issues/PRs/Designs</strong></a>, participants in the FSE program talked through the findings of the last call for testing with <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong>, <strong>Marcus Kazmierczak</strong> and <strong>Sabrina Zeidan</strong>.

In 2021,  we will &#8220;see the introduction of the most significant change to WordPress themes since the modern theme system was released in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2005/02/strayhorn/\">version 1.5</a>&nbsp;of WordPress, 16 years ago.&#8221;. He has great explanation and insights, and embraces the new era and is happy about the slow release this time around, so theme developers can get familiar with the new tools. &#8220;Developers will have plenty of time to create fully block-based themes by the time the Site Editor and Global Styles are released in WordPress 5.9. And no excuses if they don’t.&#8221; Last month, Anders released a new free theme called <a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/teman/eksell-wordpress-theme/\"><strong>Eskell</strong></a>. Read <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/eksell-portfolio-theme-now-available-in-wordpress-themes-directory\">Sarah Gooding&#8217;s review on  WordPress Tavern.</a> </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The 47th edition of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/04/30/gutenberg-themes-week-of-apr-26-2021/\"><strong>Gutenberg + Themes roundup</strong></a> by <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/one_maggie\">Maggie Cabrera</a></strong> from the Themes team, lists all FSE related issues and PRs from the Gutenberg repository that need your attention, your opinion and your comments. The post also provides a list of resources if you are just now getting into block-based theme development. One issue caught my eye specifically: <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/31124\"><em>Presets used in patterns: register them as user presets?</em></a> in it Andre explores a way how block pattern could be used across a theme change and still keep their styling. Reading through the comments from the Gutenberg contributors, it&#8217;s clear that there are a few questions still unanswered, when users can change colors. This applies to a few other elements of the themes and blocks, when classes don&#8217;t survive a theme change, and designs in navigation or group blocks lose their background colors. There are quite a few of these discussions that need your input and ideas. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his latest post, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ChrisWiegman\"><strong>Chris Wiegman</strong></a> walks us through the process of reducing WordPress themes to the bar minimum and still be able to render blocks. <strong><a href=\"https://chriswiegman.com/2021/04/creating-a-minimal-wordpress-theme-in-the-era-of-gutenberg/\">Creating A Minimal WordPress Theme In The Era Of Gutenberg</a>.</strong> This <a href=\"https://github.com/chriswiegman/chriswiegman-theme\">minimalistic and sustainable theme is available on GitHub</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>If you are looking to share your future block-based theme in the WordPress.org repository, <strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/carolinapoena\">Carolina Nymark</a></strong> has a proposal for you: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2021/04/22/removing-blockers-for-block-themes/\"><strong>Removing blockers for block themes</strong></a> on the Themes team. I am quite surprised that it hasn&#8217;t received any feedback from the community yet. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his post <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/themes-set-up-for-a-paradigm-shift-wordpress-5-8-will-unleash-tools-to-make-it-happen\"><strong>Themes Set Up for a Paradigm Shift, WordPress 5.8 Will Unleash Tools To Make It Happen</strong></a> Justin Tadlock took a tour around the upcoming WordPress 5.8 features and took them for a spin and a first evaluation.  &#8220;Themes are not going the way of the dinosaur. All of that overly complex PHP code work necessary in the past might just be. The shift is putting themes back into their proper place: design. Previously available tools such as patterns and styles coupled with the new pieces like&nbsp;<code>theme.json</code>&nbsp;and template-related blocks will be the backbone of the new system. It is all starting to come together.&#8221; he concluded. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a former Theme developer, <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> keeps his ear to the ground of theme development. I very much appreciate the tremendous effort he puts into his Theme reviews. I learn something new every time.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/churel-is-a-colorful-and-minimalist-block-ready-wordpress-theme\">Churel Is a Colorful and Minimalist Block-Ready WordPress Theme</a></li><li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/with-some-hits-and-misses-the-guten-blog-wordpress-theme-has-potential\">With Some Hits and Misses, the Guten Blog WordPress Theme Has Potential</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>10 &#8211; 14 May 2021</strong><br /><a href=\"https://pagebuildersummit.com/\"><strong>Page Builder Summit 2021</strong></a><br />Gutenberg is part of it with the following sessions: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>How to turn Gutenberg into a Page Builder with Stackable w/ <strong>Benjamin Intal</strong></li><li>Don’t Compete with Gutenberg &#8211; Embrace It w/ <strong>Danielle Zarcaro</strong></li><li>Google&#8217;s Core Web Vitals &#8211; Get Green With Gutenberg w/ <strong>Jake Pfohl</strong></li><li>Creating newsletters in the Gutenberg block editor w/ <strong>Lesley Sim</strong></li><li>Building Fast, Block Based Landing Pages with <strong>Mike Oliver</strong></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>May 24-28, 2021</strong><br /><a href=\"https://wordsesh.com/\"><strong>WordSesh 2021</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>June 7 &#8211; 9th, 2021</strong><br /><strong><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Europe</a></strong><br />A virtual event and contributor day. <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2021/call-for-sponsors/\">Call for Sponsors is open.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>June 20 &#8211; 26</strong><br /><strong><a href=\"https://japan.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp Japan</a></strong><br /><em>The schedule has been posted.

This is a feature I&#8217;ve been thinking a lot about over the last year and I&#8217;m excited to share with you all. I&#8217;m also really keen to learn from each of you what you&#8217;re worried about, what you&#8217;re excited about, how you think full-site editing can improve your workflows, and more. So this is prerecorded because I wanted to make sure with so much information going around, wanted to make sure I had all the details lined up and so I could pause and rework certain sections. But please know that I welcome questions. So while you can&#8217;t interrupt me during the presentation, there will be a whole section at the end. Pull out your pen and paper, write them down, and know that they&#8217;re very, very welcomed. But for now, let&#8217;s dig in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So briefly about me, I&#8217;m actually originally from Winter Park, Florida. So I haven&#8217;t been home in about a year and a half, and thank you for letting me virtually return home by participating in this meetup. In 2011, I first found WordPress as a student at UNC Chapel Hill. I worked on their multi-site, had a great time. 2013, I went to my first ever WordCamp. 2014, joined Automatic as a happiness engineer focused on VaultPress and had a great time focusing on security of websites. It gave me a really interesting look into concerns people have about websites that most people don&#8217;t think about. Then 2020, I switched into the developer relations position at Automatic and have been there ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s get meta and talk about the talk. (laughing). So to start, I&#8217;m going to zoom out really big and then slowly put pieces together until we kind of get a nice map of what full-site editing is with all the details. So this will look kind of like first answering some big, high-level questions, digging into then how the work is actually being done, so going from high level, &#8220;What is this? Why does it help me?&#8221; to &#8220;How is this work actually being approached? What are the pieces of the work that I need to know, the role of the outreach program?&#8221; Then I want to address some key topics and questions that I often get asked when I&#8217;ve presented at other places and talked on other podcasts about full-site editing or just one-on-one with people. I love to talk about full-site editing. So hopefully some of the key topics and questions can help get people thinking about other things they want to ask about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s dig into the first big picture question. Why is this being done at all? Simply put, it&#8217;s to empower users. Rather than having a specific part of the site locked away in a theme or requiring a plugin, full-site editing will basically open it up to customize any part of your site the way you want to, or, on the flip side, you can let it be, or if you&#8217;re an agency, you could lock certain sites down or certain parts of a site down, depending upon how you want users to have access. So it&#8217;s a pretty powerful, big mission to actually deliver on full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I answered why is this being done. Now let&#8217;s dig into how does this fit into the WordPress roadmap? So full-site editing is a major part of phase two of the current roadmap. It&#8217;s not the only part, though. There&#8217;s actually other interrelated projects, including things like block patterns, the block directory, block-based themes. So it&#8217;s just one piece of this larger roadmap, but it&#8217;s one of the major grounding points of phase two of the roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is full-site editing at a high level? Essentially, it&#8217;s a collection of features, and it&#8217;s important that you get the collection part. But it&#8217;s a collection of features that bring the familiar experience of blocks to all parts of your site, rather than just posts and pages. But Anne, what does a collection of features mean? Basically, I&#8217;ve noticed people tend to refer to full-site editing as one big thing. It&#8217;s like an on-off switch. It&#8217;s this monolith, and it&#8217;s actually not. It&#8217;s not this binary thing. It&#8217;s way better to talk about how there&#8217;s different pieces that fit together and interrelate, because it actually gives flexibility for release squads to release what&#8217;s ready, rather than all of it at once. So while it might be easier to talk about how it&#8217;s this one big thing, I encourage you all to kind of think about the different pieces, if you can, and I&#8217;ll touch on this more in a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So what does full-site editing actually allow me to do, right? So cool, Anne, a collection of features, but show me the money. (laughing). So this is an example of a 404 page. So a 404 page, typically you&#8217;re not actually able to edit, but with full-site editing, you could actually create this 404 page. This was actually done by one of the automatic designers, Channing. Shout-out to Channing. She did this as part of one of the tests for full-site editing, the outreach program. So it&#8217;s a pretty beautiful thing. While we all might not have the design chops that Channing does, it is pretty neat to see kind of a very tangible, hands-on example of what full-site editing unlocks you to be able to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get more specific, basically, if you&#8217;re a user, imagine editing the template that a specific post has for a specific category. For theme authors, you&#8217;ll be able to tap into design tools that allow you to focus more on actually creating a really compelling experience and less on getting the code in place and hacking things up. You can also out in and out of whatever you&#8217;re ready for, which is really exciting. But ideally, for theme authors, it&#8217;s going to be a huge change. It&#8217;ll allow creating themes to be much, much easier. If you&#8217;re an agency, you&#8217;ll have greater control over what you can offer clients, including setting custom brand colors with presets to locking down various aspects for consistency, such as typography or wanting only certain default colors to be used.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"0-strong-milestones-of-full-site-editing-experience-strong\">Milestones of Full-Site Editing Experience</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So how is this work being done? So rather than trying to go through everything in one go, this project has actually been broken down into seven different milestones. Some of these milestones are completely separate, their own thing. Some are very interrelated. Some mix and match in different ways. But we&#8217;re going to go through each of them so you can get a sense of how this is being done. I&#8217;m going to try to stay at a high level before going into a very brief demo midway through the presentation. But hopefully this&#8217;ll give you a sense of what this looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"1-strong-infrastructure-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-strong\">Infrastructure&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So milestone one, this was actually such a big milestone that it was broken into two parts. Essentially, this is all about laying the foundation, everything from multi-entity saving, which is actually being displayed here in the GIF that you see, where you can actually update multiple things at once, including a template part. You update your header, you update a post, and you update your footer. It&#8217;ll show all the changes happening and allow you to check and uncheck different boxes to save. Basically, just think about this as building the foundation of the experience, the technical foundation, unlocking things like being able to edit a template directly to working on specific blocks for full-site editing, like the site title. So we have a site title block, and it updates everywhere you have it listed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"2-strong-browsing-templates-and-template-parts-strong\">Browsing Templates and Template Parts</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Milestone two, browsing. Again, there&#8217;s another little visual so you can see what this actually looks like. This is basically giving you a map and a GPS to know your location, how to get where you need to go for your site. So because there are these new parts of editing your site that are unlocked with full-site editing, like template editing and template parts, like a header or footer, there needs to be a way to navigate between them. So this milestone is dedicated to that. How can we make it as easy as possible for you to you get where you need to go?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"3-strong-styling-global-styles-theme-json-strong\">Styling &#8211; Global Styles + theme.json</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Milestone three, styling. So this actually covers a couple different layers. I&#8217;m going to break it down in this slide and then the next one to help give you a sense visually of what this looks like. But this includes everything from the technical requirements to make various levels work and the UI for users. So you can actually see a depiction of the future design for the UI that users will interact with in the imagery here. So there&#8217;s generally three layers, including selling for local blocks, theme defaults, and then global modifications or what we often call global styles. You can think of global styles as basically having the option to edit all aspects of your site. So if you want to set a typography that goes across your entire site, if you want to have certain colors for all H1 headers, you can set that up with global styles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, much of the work has been focused on the technical underpinnings, especially around aspects like theme.json, which is a very key component for block themes and a really big tool for block theme authors. But for 5.8, the focus is generally going to be on merging the non-user interface parts of global styles. So don&#8217;t expect to interact with this system unless you&#8217;re a theme author. If you are a theme authro, get really excited. Here&#8217;s a little visual, just you can get a sense of it. So these are the different layers that have to interact in the styling system and hierarchy that needs to be thought of when working on this milestone.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"4-strong-20-theme-blocks-strong\">20+ Theme Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Milestone four, theme blocks. So because full-site editing opens up so many more aspects of the site to edit, new blocks had to be created, basically. So if you&#8217;re creating a new template for a specific category and you&#8217;re putting in post content and you want to add the post author block, which you can see here, you can quickly add it in, customize it to your liking, add in post comment, add in post data, remove the post date. You can edit each parts of these things, which pretty excited about this, is there&#8217;s actually 20-plus blocks that fall into this category. If all goes as planned, some of those will be released for 5.8 and available potentially for all sites. So even if you&#8217;re not using a block theme, you could have access to these theme blocks, which is pretty powerful and pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"5-strong-query-block-the-loop-or-post-list-strong\">Query Block &#8211; The Loop or Post List</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Query block. So the query block has its own milestone, because it&#8217;s a pretty powerful block. It&#8217;s also meant to be a theme author tool, so in the long run, if you&#8217;re a user, imagine that you interact with what we call block variations, which basically are just different variations of a block, as the name implies. But imagine you want to add in your latest post. You&#8217;ll add the latest post block, but underneath it, what will be powering that experience of adding your latest post will be the query block. Essentially, as the name implies, it allows you to query posts and pages and display them in different arrangements on the page. I&#8217;m very excited, actually. In Gutenberg 10.5, which will be released in just about two weeks, there&#8217;s going to be some new patterns. You can see right here, large, medium, small are the current selection of patterns that you have for the query block. But pretty soon, there&#8217;s going to be a grid pattern and a couple other cool ones, which is pretty exciting. Generally speaking, though, if you&#8217;re an end user, don&#8217;t expect to interact with this. If you&#8217;re a theme author, get excited.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"6-strong-navigation-block-strong\">Navigation Block</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Navigation block. Again, this is just a single block, but don&#8217;t be fooled. It&#8217;s definitely a mighty one. So this last one is dedicated to all things navigation block, both in terms of structure and design. You can see in this little GIF I have going on, I&#8217;m just kind of making little design changes and moving things around so you can get a sense of what it&#8217;s like to interact with this block. This milestone actually includes everything from how do you build a really simple menu with a few items to thinking about how to create a really large mega menu and add in new blocks, like the search block that you can see here. We&#8217;re even adding sub-menus, different designs, different layouts, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"7-strong-gradual-adoption-widgets-customizer-hybrid-themes-nbsp-strong\">Gradual Adoption &#8211; Widgets, Customizer, Hybrid Themes&nbsp;</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So the last piece of the milestones is the gradual adoption. I hope this GIF makes you laugh, but also seriously, this is the intent, is we slowly want people to be able to adapt in the way that they can. Once more of these pieces are completed, there&#8217;s basically a ton of room to start exploring how adoption might look like for those who can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to restructure a full theme. So this might be an intermix of block-based things and regular PHP templates, or it might be covered by projects like the block-based widget editor and the navigation screen. Both of those projects I&#8217;ll cover later, but for now, just keep in mind that this is intentionally a milestone. We want to allow for gradual adoption and want people to have lots of pathways in to taking advantage of full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"8-strong-whats-coming-to-word-press-5-8-strong\">What&#8217;s coming to WordPress 5.8</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So what&#8217;s coming to WordPress 5.8? So just last week, a post went out from Josepha, who is the executive director of the WordPress project. I want to read a quote from it just to kind of set the tone and give you a sense. So full-site editing is a collection of projects, and together, they represent a big change, arguably too much for a single release. The most important context to share is that it isn&#8217;t shipping as the full default experience for users. One of the clearest pieces of feedback from the phase one merge process was that there wasn&#8217;t enough time for extenders, agencies, theme authors, plugin developers, site builders, et cetera to prepare for the upcoming changes. With that in mind, this merge process won&#8217;t be an on-off switch, and you can see I&#8217;ve bolded various specific parts that I hope you take home with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So let&#8217;s talk WordPress 5.8 plans. This is up-to-date information as of today. A post was released from Josepha on [inaudible 00:12:21], if you&#8217;d like to check it out. From the call that the project leadership had, this is what they came up with for the 5.8 plans. This includes improvements from Gutenberg 9.9 and beyond. So we always package different versions of Gutenberg into major releases. This release is no different. There&#8217;ll be an introduction of new blocks, including query, site logo, navigation, et cetera. These are each very powerful blocks, very exciting to see. theme.json mechanism, this is part of what allows block themes to use different global styling, which will be very cool for block authors to get their hands on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The template editor for pages and a blank template, I&#8217;ll actually be showing a demo of this in a moment. So hang tight there, but it&#8217;ll all make sense in a bit. The widget screen and block widgets in the customizer, this is basically work being done to bring blocks to the widgets experience. I will talk more about that later, about how it&#8217;s a stepping stone towards full-site editing. Then finally, design tools, so even more design tools that people can hook into, including duotone, which adds a really cool color filter, layout controls, padding, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"9-strong-short-demo-template-editing-navigation-block-and-multi-entity-saving-strong\">Short Demo: Template Editing, Navigation Block and Multi-Entity Saving</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So at this point, let&#8217;s pause for a minute and actually show off one of the features that is aimed to be included in 5.8.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going to show you template editing, the navigation block, and just some of the cool flows with multi-entity saving is one of the things that we talked about that will make it into this release. So I&#8217;m in the post editor. I have a new post. I love to blog and write and present. I hit Update. Super happy, whatever. Open up the post settings, and there&#8217;s this new section that allows you to both create a brand new template. This will ideally be used both in themes that are block-based themes, so they&#8217;re ready for full-site editing, and potentially for classic themes. There&#8217;s actually work underway so that this will be available in anything being used in WordPress right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So right now, if I hit Edit, this will take me into the template that this post is using. So let&#8217;s do that now. So as you can see, this drops me into what looks like the entire site. So you can see I have my header up here, I have the footer down here, and I can make changes directly to them. So, for example, if I jump in here, this is the navigation block, and I haven&#8217;t yet set it up. So I can say add all pages, and I can start empty. In this case, I&#8217;ll say, &#8220;You know what? Let&#8217;s start empty.&#8221; Let&#8217;s say I want to add a custom link. One of the cool things you can actually do, you can quickly select from here, or let&#8217;s say I want to add a new post. Let me first select post link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So adventures around the world. Let&#8217;s pretend I&#8217;m just inspired where I&#8217;m writing this. I can actually create a draft post, which is pretty cool, and it&#8217;ll show up here. It will not show up on the front end, since it&#8217;s a draft, but it actually creates a page draft for this with this title automatically. So let&#8217;s say I&#8217;m scrolling through here. I&#8217;m going, &#8220;Oh, this looks pretty good. Actually, I kind of want to see what it looks like if I add an image to the post here.&#8221; Pull up an image block. Oh, my media library. Hammocks. Can&#8217;t get enough hammocks. Going to throw that in there. Great. So at this point, I&#8217;ve made changes to the actual header. I&#8217;ve made changes to the post. I&#8217;m just going to apply and see what happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is the multi-entity saving that I mentioned earlier. Now, as you can see, it has a section for posts, so it&#8217;s saying, &#8220;Hey, you edited this post,&#8221; and it has a section saying, &#8220;Hey, you edited the header.&#8221; So at this point, I&#8217;m going to hit Save, because I want both those changes to propagate. Now I&#8217;m back into my post, into the writing flow, and I can easily switch back and forth. I can also select a new one. But yeah, hopefully this gives you a good sense of one of the key parts that&#8217;s being worked on for inclusion in 5.8. There will be a demo later, but this is just a taste.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"10-strong-timeline-of-5-8-release-strong\">Timeline of 5.8 Release</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To help set the stage for what you can prepare for, here are some upcoming dates to keep in mind. If you&#8217;re like me, time is moving really strangely, so I like to have dates to kind of anchor me. Feel free to take a screenshot of this or write it down if you&#8217;d like. So April 13th and April 27th, these are the go and no-go decision dates. So right now, project leadership actually has gathered. So you might notice if you are good with dates and good with time right now, April 13th has come and gone. So this date has passed, and project leadership has met actually to go through different FSE-related features and projects to figure out what might be ready for 5.8. I would expect to see more high-level posts throughout the month, especially after the second date, the April 27th date. That&#8217;s when final decisions will be made around 5.8.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then if all goes well, the beta period for WordPress 5.8 will start on June 8th. So people can actually start getting their hands on the tools that are going to be in place in the actual release and testing it and finding bugs and improving things from there. July 20th is the actual date of WordPress 5.8 and when it&#8217;s released. This is being considered as an open beta, where theme authors, plugin authors, agencies, and more can dig into the tools that are being offered and that I went over previously. Then in December 2021, that&#8217;s around the time when WordPress 5.9 will be released, and this is when I expect to move from tools for extenders into tools actually for users and more user-facing interactions with full-site editing and having things unlocked in the interface that previously in 5.8, most users won&#8217;t notice and won&#8217;t interact with. In 5.9, I expect that to be more visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So some key takeaways. I know this is a lot of information. So only what&#8217;s ready from the various milestones will be shipped. This is not an on-off switch, and it won&#8217;t take over your site. The focus right now is on giving tools to extenders first, before user-facing changes. That&#8217;s a big lesson that was learned from the 5.0 merge, where Gutenberg and the core editor was brought into the WordPress experience. This is something that, thankfully, we&#8217;re in a position where because of these interrelated projects, we&#8217;re able to move in a more flexible and adaptable way to release what&#8217;s ready and not anything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"11-strong-what-is-the-fse-outreach-experiment-program-strong\">What is the FSE Outreach Experiment Program?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. At this point, let&#8217;s jump into the full-site editing outreach program. As a reminder, this is the program that I actually run, so consider this free rein to ask me whatever question you&#8217;d like, because I think probably too much about this program. But it&#8217;s something I&#8217;m really excited to talk to you about, and I think it&#8217;s a really neat vehicle for both feedback and education about full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s go over some big picture questions, kind of like we did earlier on, and just get the details of the way. So let&#8217;s start. What is it? So essentially, it&#8217;s just a program focused on full-site editing. It&#8217;s in the form of a Slack channel right now. I&#8217;ll go over how to join it in a bit. But it has curated calls for testing, summary posts of the feedback that we get, and various educational opportunities that you can hop in on, mainly in the form of live streams. I&#8217;m running some hallway hangouts, which are basically just Zoom calls. People can come in, and we can talk about full site editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"12-strong-whats-the-goal-strong\">What&#8217;s the goal</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the goal? So the goal is pretty simple, help improve full-site editing experience by gathering feedback from WordPress site builders. While the group originally started solely to be about feedback, there&#8217;s actually this really neat educational component that has come up as the feature has developed and as more people have gotten curious about it. So people can join just to build their own awareness about what&#8217;s happening with full-site editing and kind of just look at a glance or just help amplify the posts that are coming through.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"13-strong-why-was-it-started-strong\">Why was it started?</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Why was it started? So I&#8217;m going to quote Josepha from the kickoff post. During the WordPress 5.0 retrospective, which is when Gutenberg was merged and the core editor was merged, one of the things that came up routinely was the need for better engagement with users. It was generally agreed from all levels and area of contribution that users would be most impacted by Gutenberg, but the users were also the group we had the least channels of communication to. To help get user feedback to WordPress developers a little bit more seamlessly, I&#8217;m going to try and experiment outreach program. So basically, this is a lesson that was learned from the 5.0 release. In order to prevent another situation where people are caught by surprise, this program is in place to help people get excited and on ramped and on boarded onto full-site editing, as well as getting feedback so that we know if a major workflow change is coming into play, we can actually get user feedback to make it a little bit easier.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"14-strong-how-to-join-fse-outreach-experiment-strong\">How to Join FSE Outreach Experiment</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. At this point, I bet you&#8217;re just so stoked. You&#8217;re ready to dive in. Awesome. (laughing). All you&#8217;ve got to do is join FSE Outreach Experiment in Make WordPress Slack, and then you&#8217;re all set. You&#8217;ll just get a bunch of annoying pings for me with prompts for how to test, interesting posts related to full site editing, and more. I promise it&#8217;s also not as scary as this dive, which looks absolutely terrifying, but also beautiful.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"15-strong-high-level-feedback-from-calls-for-testing-strong\">High-Level Feedback from Calls for Testing</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So because at this point, we&#8217;re on our fifth call for testing, I want to go over some high-level pieces of feedback that we&#8217;ve actually gotten about the experience so far. Basically, across all the calls for testing, these are repeated themes that have come up. But keep in mind that because there are certain aspects that we actually haven&#8217;t tested, so global styles, for example, the UI isn&#8217;t available really for users, and it&#8217;s not refined for users, so it&#8217;s not something that we&#8217;ve had as a focus part of testing, even though there is a UI that is available. So certain things are left out purely because they aren&#8217;t necessarily ready for testing, but these are the top pieces of feedback. So bear with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"16-strong-preview-content-strong\">Preview Content</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Previewing content. Publish a post. You want to go preview it, or you&#8217;re editing a post. You want to go preview the content. The same thing is true with full site editing. This is a big thing that kept coming up. My question is, is this a necessary workflow, or is it a symptom of other problems? Because in general, the site editor should be as WYSIWYG, as what you see is what you get, as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re making a change, it should look exactly the same as the front end of your site, and because it doesn&#8217;t right now, it&#8217;s causing this tension. There actually is a preview site option under discussion, as well as a browse mode option, which basically, if you&#8217;re actually editing your site, it would turn off everything that wouldn&#8217;t actually show up on the front end. So if you only have one page of posts, but you have pagination set up so if you had multiple pages, that would actually go away. So as you can imagine, this is currently up for discussion, but there actually are a couple different pathways to try and address this problem. But it&#8217;s a very important one to address.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"17-strong-saving-process-strong\">Saving Process</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Saving process. I like to say it&#8217;s technically reliable, but not yet delightful. So basically, it&#8217;s left a lot to be desired right now, and it&#8217;s resulted in a fair bit of confusion. There&#8217;s a lot of feature requests and enhancements and bugs that have come up related to saving. This is likely because the multi-entity saving aspect that I demoed earlier is very new for WordPress users. It&#8217;s not something we&#8217;re used to having as part of our workflow. So it&#8217;s something that inherently needs some work on. So whether it was people requesting more granular saving options to show specifically what was being changed to issues with saving for screen readers to confusion around even just what the general parts mean, like what you&#8217;re actually selecting or unselecting, This was definitely a big, big area of feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"18-distinction-between-editing-area\">Distinction between editing area.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Distinction between editing area. So basically, because you can edit all parts of your site, it&#8217;s hard to know, &#8220;Am I editing the header for all of my site, or am I editing just a specific piece of content on a post?&#8221; This kind of distinction, jumping between different levels of, &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re changing this. This will change everything&#8221; to &#8220;You&#8217;re just changing this one thing in this one spot&#8221; is pretty tricky. Right now, there&#8217;s not a lot of friction, and there&#8217;s not a lot clarity in the actual experience to show when you&#8217;re actually jumping between those different levels. So this was a big piece that&#8217;s come up, and it&#8217;s something that is an active area of iteration and exploration to kind of get the right amount of friction in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"19-rethinking-width-and-alignment\">Rethinking Width and Alignment.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>So rethinking width and alignment. Previously, alignment in full-site editing worked to optimize how traditional things worked, where basically, traditional things provided their own alignment styles. This worked okay for the project up until this point. But recently, work has been shipped to reimagine how this dynamic should work to allow for actually more control over alignments when using the site editor. This should actually help make sure that whether you want something that&#8217;s full width or you want to change the actual width of your content that&#8217;s showing up that it&#8217;ll actually be what you see is what you get. Right now, this is another piece of feedback at a high level that&#8217;s impacted what you see is what you get experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"20-strong-general-usability-improvements-strong\">General usability improvements.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally usability improvements. I admit this is totally a catchall, and it covers a ton of stuff, but it&#8217;s actually a very important one to think of, because it&#8217;ll actually move the site editing experience from being just functional to actually delightful, which is really exciting. There&#8217;s a ton of issues that are included in this, including some enhancement requests, bug reports, all that good stuff. One of my favorites to talk about is creating a background image on a template part. So imagine you have a header. You&#8217;re working on it. You&#8217;re super excited, and you&#8217;re almost done. Then you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, do you what would be really cool is if I had mountains in the background. Maybe I&#8217;ll add a cover block in the background and add an image and set the opacity pretty low, but have mountains going in the background of the site.&#8221; That&#8217;s really hard to do.(laughing). You basically would have to delete everything and add the block in and then add everything back. So those are the kinds of experiences that we&#8217;re trying to improve right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 id=\"21-strong-improving-placeholders-strong\">Improving Placeholders.</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Improving placeholders. So placeholders, especially for some of the newer blocks, are a powerful way to both guide people and a current point of confusion. So you probably saw this with the navigation block earlier, where it had those little grayed boxes. It&#8217;s like, &#8220;How do we explain to people, &#8216;Hey, this is something you have to set up and engage with, but here&#8217;s generally what it will look like and what it will do&#8217;?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The feedback for this mainly came into play with the query block, social icon block, featured image block, and the navigation block. Each currently actually also get users started in different ways. So not only are there different placeholders for different experiences, the actual experience of interacting with the placeholders are all pretty inconsistent right now. So I think in the long run, it seems that users will benefit a bunch from a standardized, consistent way to interact with placeholder content so that it becomes a really familiar interaction when you&#8217;re working with a more powerful block. This especially is true for the query block and navigation block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, now that we&#8217;ve covered the milestones, the outreach program, high-level pieces of feedback, I&#8217;m going to quickly run through some key topics that I imagine you&#8217;re going to have questions about. Just because I cover them here does not mean I don&#8217;t want to answer questions, so please don&#8217;t see this as a sign that you can&#8217;t also still ask questions about these topics. This is just what I&#8217;ve been hearing from folks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"22-strong-will-full-site-editing-take-over-my-site-strong\">Will full site editing take over my site?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully by this point, you all can say no in a resounding way. But no, this is not something that&#8217;s going to all of a sudden, on-off switch, you upgrade to 5.8, it takes everything over. Not at all. You very much have to opt into it through using a theme blocking that supports, actually, these features. In time, more pathways are going to be built as well so that when you&#8217;re actually using full-site editing, you&#8217;ll likely be using pieces in all of it. So you could just be using the query block, or you could just be using global styles without it taking over your entire site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"23-strong-what-about-the-block-based-navigation-and-widget-screens-strong\">What about the block-based navigation and widget screens?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What&#8217;s the deal there? So in case you missed it, there&#8217;s actually two additional projects that are dedicated to bringing blocks to more areas of the site outside of full site, I think. This include the navigation screens. You can build out menus and the widget screens. You can build out your widget sections, and this is pretty powerful and high-impact work. They are both separate projects that are tangential to full-site editing, but you can think of them as stepping stones, basically. So you could have a theme that is a classic theme, but it uses a block-based widget screen so that people can have the power blocks with their widgets. Essentially, the whole point, like I said, it&#8217;s a stepping stone to get people used to using blocks more places.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"24-strong-site-builders-strong\">Site builders</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I could write a thesis about this, because there&#8217;s so much to talk about here. I imagine I&#8217;m going to get questions about this, but essentially, full-site editing is being built partially so people don&#8217;t get stuck or locked into one site builder or another. It&#8217;s also being built in a way that site builders can actually hook into what&#8217;s being created if they choose to. I&#8217;ve heard from a lot of folks, though, that they expect full-site editing to actually fully replicate their favorite site builder&#8217;s functionality, and I&#8217;m here to say that while the goals between full-site editing and site builders are pretty similar in terms of empowering users and giving better tools to customize a site, the difference is that we&#8217;re building for 40% of the Internet, and we&#8217;re building even for site builders, where site builders have a much more targeted approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the future, I do think there will always be room for specific takes of how to have an ideal site editing experience, whether that&#8217;s geared to a specific group, like a marketing style approach, or if you want to have things locked down or if you want to have things opened up. But generally speaking, full-site editing is meant to actually expand the way WordPress as a whole uses blocks, so don&#8217;t expect it to fully replicate any sort of site builder, your favorite site builder, essentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"25-strong-how-is-this-going-to-impact-themes-strong\">How is this going to impact themes?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>How is this going to impact themes? So in the long run, this should actually make theme development much easier. I think Marcus&#8217;s demonstration later will show that, and much simpler, especially with the design tools that will be essentially ready at your fingertips to tap into. Ideally, because of what&#8217;s being released, it should allow theme authors to focus less on coding and functions and more on design aesthetics, integrating block patterns, and all that good stuff. But because one of the key things I wanted to really drive home in this section, though, is that because full-site editing requires a block-based theme or a theme with certain functionality enabled, this makes theming extremely important to get right. So I&#8217;ve heard people say like, &#8220;Oh, themes are a thing of the past.&#8221; It&#8217;s very much not true. I&#8217;d actually argue the opposite, that theme is almost key to this experience, to having it be delightful and having it makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"26-strong-what-pathways-are-going-to-be-created-strong\">What pathways are going to be created?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I know I&#8217;ve talked a lot about pathways this entire time, but it is the entire focus of the final month milestone for full-site editing. So expect a lot of pathways. For now, this includes everything from having a classic theme that can take advantage of global styles to template editing or a block-based widget screen. This also includes things like allowing certain full-site editing, really, blocks to be available for users, regardless of if they&#8217;re using a classic theme or a block theme or enabling the ability to edit block templates directly, kind of like I showed in the demo earlier. So there&#8217;s going to be a ton of options here, and I&#8217;m actually really excited to see what happens once 5.8 kind of sparks the creativity of the community, because I imagine both that people will create their own pathways and start experimenting, and we&#8217;ll also get a very clear sense of, &#8220;Hey, I actually really need X, Y, and Z pathway.&#8221; We&#8217;ll get a sense of demand from the community of core, which is super exciting to have.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"27-strong-whats-the-best-way-to-prepare-nbsp-strong\">What&#8217;s the best way to prepare?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>So this depends on who you are. (laughing). So depending on whoever you are, at a high level, this is what I recommend. Join the FSE Outreach Program. I know this is the thing that I run. I&#8217;m very biased. But seriously, join it. I think it&#8217;s really, really helpful to get a sense both of feedback, what&#8217;s being currently iterated on, and just general education opportunities. If you&#8217;re a theme author, I really recommend checking out the theme experiments repo and joining the block-based theme meetings to learn about the latest and greatest, because lots of good information is shared there. In general, too, it&#8217;s often also helpful to join the weekly core editor meetings, because there&#8217;s regular updates about the projects and PRs people working on. Finally, pay attention to upcoming content on Learn WordPress, because I think there&#8217;s going to be a ton of stuff coming up about full-site editing, depending upon what&#8217;s scoped for 5.8 and 5.9, including building a block-based theme, for example. That will really help, I think, everyone level up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"28-strong-stay-connected-with-anne-mc-carthy-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-nbsp-strong\">Stay connected with Anne McCarthy</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All right.

It&#8217;s an excellent reading list if you need to dive deeper in the upcoming changes for your theme or your customer. One of the issues caught my eye: the discussion and work around block alignment settings for themes. The current way predates the revamp of the Inner Blocks.

The refactored version is now using single image blocks inside the Gallery block. You can us all the great features: individual links per image, block styles, choices for size and editing capabilities. If you also use a plugin with your site, like CoBlocks, you can still apply the great filters and animations to your gallery block. In his post, Davies walks you through the few features and asked to test all the many facets of the new Gallery block. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the WPTavern, <strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> explains how this new change can make a lot of difference on how gallery layouts will be built.

In their conversation, they covered a lot of ground. The show is definitely worth your 40 minutes of listen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Around minute 23 of the audio they talked a bit more about Full-Site Editing and its merge into the core. Chomphosy said she knows &#8216;this summer&#8217; is an ambitions goal, and she also assured the listeners that the team won&#8217;t release something that&#8217;s not functional and usable. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Go/NoGo Mid to End of April</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Core release and Gutenberg teams will make the Go/NoGo decision to merge Full-Site Editing for the next WordPress release in July (5.8)  on April 17 or on April 23.  In other words, the state of Full Site editing in Gutenberg plugin version 10.4 and 10.5.  If it doesn&#8217;t get merged into 5.8, Full-Site Editing will be merged in WordPress 5.9 to be released in December 2021</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy also shared her &#8211; unofficial &#8211; benchmark of what should be possible with the prototype of the Site Editor by April: Can you &#8211; without writing code &#8211; create a landing page with Full-site editing tools. She calls it &#8220;the smallest viable sentence. The I-AM of websites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>A Landing page is the smallest viable unit</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This single web page consists of a header, a footer, a hero image with a button, some text, a form or a call to action.  This narrows the focus of the MVP, the prototype, considerably. It also increases the probability that the first low-key, opt-in version of Full-Site editing might actually make it into the next WordPress version. A narrow scope will also help content creators, teachers and developers get started working on their discovery of the new WordPress feature. As soon as it is merged into WordPress core, plugin developer and theme builders can test their ideas against it and get familiar with the underlying concepts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a good way to ease-in content creators, too. When you are not dealing with the header and footer of a big site, but just for a single page, it’s not so critical if you get lost on the way from content editing to template part (header, footer) editing and back again. It&#8217;s all on the same page, literally. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This transition was one of the major causes of confusion during the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2021/03/16/high-level-feedback-from-the-fse-program-march/\">first few testing calls for the FSE outreach program</a> and the developers are working on making it less confusing. With this unofficial benchmark of a single landing page creation, the team will have additional time and input on how to better handle that switch between editing a template that is used for many pages and the content of a single post or page content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A very tangible goal, &#8220;Can I build a landing page with the tools available?&#8221; makes it straightforward for WordPress contributors who work on the parts that make that are not code, like documentation, marketing, training and testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Call For Testing: Create a Header</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\">4th call for testing</a> via the WordPress FSE-Outreach program asks you to<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2021/03/25/fse-program-testing-call-4-building-a-restaurant-themed-header/\"> create a header for a Restaurant</a>. <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> has detailed instructions for you as well as video if you are in a testing mood. Your input is definitely wanted!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chomphosy also added that Matias Ventura, the technical lead for Gutenberg,  might have different benchmarks for the MVP. I am curious, and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JosephaHaden/status/1371956586516606977\">answer Josepha&#8217;s call for questions</a> on Full-Site Editing for her next episode of the WPBriefing podcast when Matias will be her guest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Full-Side Editing project encompasses a lot more than the Site Editor with template parts. There are Global Styles, Widgets in Customizer, a new Navigation and Widget screen, block-based themes with a theme.json file and query block. Some of it will work its way into the MVP. We will see how far the team progresses on their journey, that will only begin once Full-Site editing comes to Millions of WordPress users. No Fear, though. It will all be opt-in. Nothing will break. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-white-color has-secondary-background-color has-text-color has-background has-large-font-size\">&#8220;Given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&#8221; &#8212; Eric Raymond&#8217;s Linus&#8217; Law</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-container-615b7b6a35359 wp-block-group has-secondary-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<form class=\"wp-block-newsletterglue-form ngl-form ngl-portrait\" action=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/\" method=\"post\"><div class=\"ngl-form-container\"><div class=\"ngl-form-field\"><label class=\"ngl-form-label\" for=\"ngl_email\">Leave Your Email for our Weekend Edition</label><div class=\"ngl-form-input\"><input type=\"email\" class=\"ngl-form-input-text\" name=\"ngl_email\" id=\"ngl_email\" /></div></div><button class=\"ngl-form-button\">Subscribe</button><p class=\"ngl-form-text\">We hate spam, too.

When it’s released, you get to choose what happens. You can install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">Classic Editor plugin</a> today and when 5.0 is released, nothing will change. We’ve commited to supporting and updating Classic Editor until 2022. If you’d like to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">install Gutenberg early</a>, you can do that now too. The Classic Editor plugin has been available for 13 months now, and Gutenberg has been available for 18 months. Both have been heavily promoted since August 2018, and more than 1.3 million .org sites have opted-in already to either experience, so nothing will change for them when they update to 5.0.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1543929747530\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">Is it terrible to do a release in December?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">Some people think so, some don’t.

December releases actually comprise 34% of our major releases in the past decade.</p> </div> <div class=\"schema-faq-section\" id=\"faq-question-1543932662856\"><strong class=\"schema-faq-question\">What if I don’t want to update on that date, or I’m not ready?</strong> <p class=\"schema-faq-answer\">That’s totally okay, there’s nothing that says you must update the moment there’s a new version released.

Blythe, <a href=\"https://allmyfriendsarejpegs.com\">allmyfriendsarejpegs.com</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Transcript: Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s Keynote at WordCamp Europe (Excerpt)<br /></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>(&#8230;) The major features that are in effect so far are we have a block based writing experience, with over 20 blocks built in. Gutenberg is fully adaptive, meaning that whether you&#8217;re looking at it on a small screen, a medium screen, a large screen, a huge screen, the design and the functionality adapts to be fluid and easy to use on any of those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is ah, there we go &#8230; Optimized for direct manipulation of content, so we&#8217;re bringing it closer to where what you&#8217;re editing looks a lot more like what you&#8217;re seeing on the front page. They have a block aid [inaudible 00:00:43], support for static and dynamic blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Matt&#8217;s Favorite Gutenberg Feature: Copy/Paste API</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of my favorite, the universal API, which is copy and paste. Who&#8217;s ever tried to copy and paste things into the WordPress editor, or anyplace else, and it just goes kind of sideways?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg already has support for fully supported copy and paste from Google Docs, a Apple&#8217;s Pages, everyone&#8217;s favorite Microsoft Word, Office 365, Evernote, Legacy WordPress, random webpages, and then finally something that I know will be very popular with this audience is Markdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s actually what you are seeing in this little GIF there, is a copy and paste from a Markdown source. That&#8217;s a note editor or for wherever you want. You paste into Gutenberg, it translates it just instantly into Gutenberg blocks. It&#8217;s very, very slick. If you haven&#8217;t tried this yet, I&#8217;d highly recommend trying it. It&#8217;s one of my favorite hidden features alongside &#8230; I&#8217;ll tell you about my other favorite hidden feature. Which is that when you copy and paste the URL onto some text, it auto links it. Saves a ton of time.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Templates, Shared Blocks, Nested Blocks and Child Blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>There are templates for predefined blocks. This is starting to go into where you can see hints of where we are going to end up, with full site customization with this. Which basically allows you to create for your users or for yourself kind of pre-built layouts where you can say, &#8220;Okay. A title goes here, an image goes here, some text goes here, a map goes here.&#8221; That can be reused over and over again, or assigned to entire pages. There&#8217;s shared blogs, so if you do want to reuse things across the entire site, that can be a shared unified resource. So when you edit it once, it shows up everywhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, we are very excited about, that we have nested blocks and child blocks. These are blocks within blocks. Like it&#8217;s turtles and blocks all the way down, and child blocks, which only work if the parent block is there. Perhaps like your children. Media drag and drop. Extensions where you can add extra things to the sidebar. Like this beautiful &#8220;Hello Belgrade&#8221; extension here.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>30 Gutenberg releases, 1,700 issues open , 1,100 closed</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been 30 Gutenberg releases, since we started, and 12 just since WordCamp US in December. As you can see, this is kind of running through all the different releases. There have been over 1,700 issues opened, and 1,100 closed in the Gutenberg Project thus far. From the development point of view, I&#8217;m very proud of it. We have open development, design-led testing in our releases, presentations across pretty much every WordCamp now, including here. It&#8217;s developed a wide awareness. Support and awareness in every single page builder out there. You know the names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We already have people who&#8217;ve extended Gutenberg through plugins they are starting to pick up in the directory, and major sites. Agencies and others have been building and launching things with Gutenberg because, to be honest, it works. It&#8217;s not perfect yet. We&#8217;re not ready to release it yet, but for the things it does, it does them well. You can actually start using this in production already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are now 14,000 sites actively using Gutenberg. So this isn&#8217;t just installed it&#8217;s actually active. Just released this week are tools for enterprises. This one called <a href=\"https://vip.wordpress.com/2018/06/13/jumpstart-gutenberg-testing-transition-ramp/\">Gutenberg Ramp</a>, which is a new plugin from VIP which basically allows them to turn Gutenberg on for certain post ID&#8217;s, page ID&#8217;s or content text. So that way you can start to phase in. Say you have a really complex setup of WordPress and maybe certain post types of things, extra customization. You can start to turn Gutenberg on for parts of it, not for others until you get to the point where you have everything on and fully done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the question I&#8217;m going to preempt it, so you don&#8217;t need to ask it is &#8220;What&#8217;s coming next in the world of Gutenbergification?&#8221; Which is just kinda fun to say. It sounds almost like a German word right?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Roadmap For Gutenberg Roll-Out</h3>\n\n\n\n<h4>Happening in June</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the roadmap. So these are things happening in June which means they are highly .. [inaudible] . First I&#8217;m going to freeze new features coming in to Gutenberg. We&#8217;ve reached a point where there is a functionality that matches in affect of in the area it exceeds what we accomplished in the editor. We&#8217;re gonna encourage host agencies and teachers to start opting in folks that they have influence over to start using Gutenberg. Now very much &#8230; especially if it&#8217;s someone who you&#8217;re working with close to so that you can start to gather feedback from third party users of it, people who are involved in development everyday and pass that back, of course, to developers. This is to compliment the user testing, since the user testing that we&#8217;ve already been doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the hosts that&#8217;s gonna be sort of contributing to this is WordPress.com so there is several hundred thousand, in the high numbers of thousands folks from WordPress.com that actually use wp-admin interface primarily. So we&#8217;re gonna be offering a call to action to opt-in. You can start using it very soon. One of the key measures that we are tracking there are the number of sites and the number of posts that are using this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then finally the mobile apps, which I said are getting more and more popular. Right now, if you move between editing things in the mobile apps, Gutenberg, it breaks in pretty spectacular fashion. So within the next few weeks that will be all fixed up across both IOS and Android. </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Coming up in July: Thousands more users .org and .com<br /></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming up in July, there is going to be a 4.9 point WordPress release that has a <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/try-out-gutenberg-call-out-will-be-in-4-9-5-release/\">strong invitation in the dashboard.</a> The first time we&#8217;ve had this, to either install Gutenberg or the Classic Editor Plugin. So basically we will be encouraging people to get on the train early, or if when 5.0 comes out and your site is not gonna be ready for it, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/classic-editor/\">install the Classic Editor Plugin</a>. For those who don&#8217;t know, basically locks in your site to use how WordPress WYSIWYG editor&nbsp; works today. So it kinda opts you out of Gutenberg. We&#8217;re, of course, going to be tracking the use of both those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re gonna switch to opt-in for their wp-admin on dot com to be opt-out and I&#8217;m tracking who opts out and trying to gather as much data from them as well because there&#8217;s gonna be a lot of information there, especially from people who might be using third party plugins on WordPress.com. Be a heavy, heavy triage on bug gardening, getting all the blockers to zero. Then finally, we&#8217;re gonna actually kick off and maybe even branch off the customization leads to start the work for what we wanna launch hopefully this year. Which is more of the full site editing experience of Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4>In August and Beyond: Merge Proposal<br /></h4>\n\n\n\n<p>So in August and beyond we&#8217;ll have all critical issues resolved. It&#8217;ll be integrated with the Calypso interface on WordPress.com, which is where the majority of people use it. I want to have 100,000 sites, 250,000 posts made, so 100,000 sites active with Gutenberg over 10x, where it is today, about 10x where it is today. A quarter million posts I think we&#8217;ll be able to say that a lot of the bugs will be worked out. We&#8217;re gonna merge with Core beginning the 5.0 release cycle. So beta releases, translations and then finally we are planning &#8230; there&#8217;s work undergoing, it&#8217;s not ready yet, but there will be full mobile versions of Gutenberg at the end of the year in the iOS and Android app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By August, they won&#8217;t break when you move between them. Of course, Gutenberg is done in a way that makes the content and the Markup backwards compatible. We&#8217;re actually gonna have the blocks supported in the mobile apps so that as you drag and drop blocks, move them around, have different sort of fun things you can do, that&#8217;ll all be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could have a 5.0 as soon as August. Some of these things that I put up there, I&#8217;m very, very sure about. The big thing that we&#8217;re not sure about is as we vastly increase the average usage of Gutenberg across hopefully 100,000 sites. &#8220;What&#8217;s gonna come in?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Not date promised, though. </h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The non-deterministic nature of fixing bugs means that I don&#8217;t know exactly the issues that could raise.

All in all, a great read from a WordPress developer to WordPress developer on how to bridge the gap to the modern block editor. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index-2020/\">The index 2020 is here</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/ask-the-bartender-what-happens-when-block-markup-changes\">What Happens When Block Markup Changes?</a></strong> &#8211;<strong> Justin Tadlock</strong> and <strong>Riad Benguella </strong>answer a WPTavern reader&#8217;s question. It&#8217;s a fascinating read that explains some inner workings of the block editor when dealing with static JavaScript blocks. The details are fascinating, and I learned a great deal from the post. Different processes are firing depending on the context the block is used: for the edit screen, storing serialized data in the database, and rendering the block again on the front end, all the while offering hooks for 3rd party plugins to tap into those processes. It&#8217;s a delicate balancing act between the developer experience and the user experience. Riad made clear that the Gutenberg team needed to put the user experience first. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>As&nbsp;Gutenberg&nbsp;grows, the project sometimes experiences regressions: Features that used to work suddenly don’t anymore. To prevent these regressions from happening, contributors can <strong>write end-to-end (e2e) tests </strong>that cover a given piece of functionality and alert us when that functionality is broken.

This is a bit weird doing a talk like this online. If I were talking at an in-person WordCamp, we would be in the smallest room, and could have it quite interactive and have other contributors share their journey as well. So, considering how hard it is to volunteer time, especially after 2020 with working from home, and the childcare challenges, and care for older parents or worse. The latest version of WordPress 5.6 had over 600 contributors. I&#8217;m grateful that this new talk was accepted at WordFest, and I want to thank the organizers, volunteers, speakers and sponsors for making it happen. And thank you all who are interested in contributing to WordPress or at least learning more from contributors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So come work on this open source software used by hundreds of millions of users. So on the site make.wordpress.org, there are over 18 teams that have their blog there, and all the handbooks and how the team works. Not every team contributes code, and every coding team has a great need for people who don&#8217;t know how to contribute code. But all project managers can test features, facilitate meetings, discuss new features or processes, and organize meetups and speak at WordCamps.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why contributing? First, there&#8217;s the business case. In our web development business at Pauli Systems, we have been using WordPress for a decade now and made good money with it, and we worked with the software without any licensing fees or any monetary upgrade costs in a community of very generous people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Working on the project, gave us an even deeper appreciation for the work and the people behind the project. We are all standing on the shoulders of giants. Contributing to WordPress is part of giving back as much as I can. Others wrote about it, most recently the team Yoast produced a great long read about how open source brings better solutions and a more inclusive society. Apart from some street credit in form of badges, contributing to WordPress brings me personal joy, too. The last five years have been very inspiring and I learned so much for my personal growth and how to lead and work remotely as well as meeting people around the world. The kindness, patience, and professionalism is reassuring even if the rest of the world descends in chaos, fear, uncertainty and doubt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I consider many teammates friends, and as soon as we get back into in-person meetings, there will be a hugfest. The marketing team, also a Nocode team, published a longer post about why contributing to WordPress benefits everyone, or also why contributors give their skills for free. Let me leave that for an introduction into generally contributing. You were promised a case study on Nocode Contributor Journey on the WordPress GitHub Repository for Gutenberg. So let&#8217;s get to the meat of the matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Gutenberg/Block Editor team belongs to the larger core team. It&#8217;s the team developing the Block Editor and the Site Editor. I often get the question, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference between the Block Editor and Gutenberg?&#8221; So per se, there isn&#8217;t really a difference. So you can think about the Block Editor is what&#8217;s in WordPress or WordPress core, and Gutenberg is the plugin where it&#8217;s developed. Gutenberg is also the idea of a larger revamping of the whole WordPress experience. The WordPress core releases are every three to four months and the Gutenberg developers, however, release a new version for the plugin every two weeks. So when the next WordPress release comes around, all the features and fixes the plugin received since the last major release, will be merged into the core code base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for WordPress version 5.6, that was released in December, it incorporated the plugin versions 8.6 to 9.2. So Gutenberg team has regular meetings in their Slack channel on Wednesdays, 9:00 AM Eastern, 6:00 AM Pacific, sorry, West Coast people and it&#8217;s 1400 UTC. The Slack channel is separate from core, it&#8217;s #core-editor slack channel. There are also meeting notes posted on the make.wordpress.org core blog, so /org/core. And apart from meetings, most Gutenberg developers communicate on GitHub. So, let&#8217;s get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I do not contribute any code to the project. I&#8217;m not a PHP developer and my JavaScript knowledge is 10 years old. I would be useless as a developer or designer, but I use the Block Editor a lot. I mean, I spend time, many, many hours per week working in it. And the Gutenberg times, is pretty much the test site in production for the Gutenberg plugin. What I do is I create issues on the GitHub repository and the screen that you just see is just a screenshot of my issues, but we&#8217;ll go into a little bit more detail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Situations. What are the situations when I create issues? Whenever I encounter a bug or annoyance or inconsistencies, most of the time I stop what I&#8217;m doing and I create the issue, or I make a note of it so I can go back to that. I also test new features for an article. So, if I want to write about the Block Directory, I definitely want to test it before that and once in a while, I run into issues there and write up a bug report. I also do release testers, so Release Candidates from the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last but not the least is, any idea I have on future feature improvements and that&#8217;s when I feel a different approach might make a feature much more helpful for power users, or if something is missing that I find. So, let&#8217;s look about some examples. Don&#8217;t worry, I will not discuss the merit of the issues, or just go deeper into Gutenberg code or something like that, I want to show you what paths and engagement they can take.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first example is about bugs and annoyances when I click on this link. It works, excellent. I have to have it, at the right my bullet points is a normal paragraph and then when I&#8217;m done with all the bullet points, I convert them to a list. And up until summer of 2018, I found it very easy to do this in the Block Editor and with the next version for this, I encountered that it wouldn&#8217;t work anymore.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When you&#8217;re scrolling through this, that one was pretty fast resolved. Matias gave me a hint that I can do this now through the transform button that was back then just introduced. So that was easy, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next one was also a bug, but it had to do with the Meta Box. And so the Meta Box would scroll up to the top of the editor instead of staying put on the bottom of it and it seems that there are still quite a few people who were able to replicate it. Joen kind of said, &#8220;Oh, I was able to reproduce, so that was all good.&#8221; But then he also said that while debugging this, he found that that was actually an upstream issue from a plugin. This issue was closed, but then here was the issue at the Yoast GitHub repository, so I was able to follow along there and then tested again when the new Yoast plugin was then released. So those two were all bug reports, but then I also test new features.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the first example here is for the widget screen. So it was just recently last in October, the calendar block triggered an error, developers reproduced it and labeled it with a calendar widget, and screen, and debug and bug. And then what happened was that in October, it was reproducible and then just a few days ago, Robert Anderson also tested it again, if this is still something that needs to be taken care of, and obviously, that has now moved to development.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the test Release Candidates, I have two examples, warning of a missing file which was almost instantly resolved because it was a Release Candidate, and a day later there was the plugin fix and another one was…. In this one that was issued, the audio block did a disappearing act in the editor and that was also fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can imagine that it has increased the quality of the plugin when these kinds of bugs are caught before the final release. But it was hit and miss for me to be able to test the Release Candidates because there are only two days in between. Since mid-December, they changed the frequency of it, and so now it&#8217;s a seven-day period and we can do some more consistent testing of the Release Candidates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I do Feature Improvements issues and this one might interest a few. So the keyboard shortcut to switch to HTML editing on a block level. There&#8217;s a shortcut keyboard to change the whole editor from visual to code similar to the classic editor where you have your text and the visual kind of tabs. But I found with a block-based idea, I&#8217;m normally not going through the whole code of a whole post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I want to fiddle with HTML of a block, it&#8217;s mostly block-based, so I suggested to have that implemented because it would ease the flow of things as well. And although menu items actually have keyboard shortcuts, so it would also fall into the consistency of that. Well, I suggested as of September 2018, and there was a lot of engagement there, cool idea that really make sense, Mattias got involved. But still in December, so in November, there was some discussion about it, and there were quite a few who tried it and then didn&#8217;t get finished with the PR or with the code base. So I hope that sooner or later, a developer finds time to work through this to get this going. But that&#8217;s a classic example that even if you have a good idea, it does not always make it into a developer&#8217;s head, so we always also need to find a developer for actually implementing those features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last one that I&#8217;ll share with you is a Feature Improvement that you might want to help support, that&#8217;s a user triggered search in the Block Directory. So right now in the Block Directory, if you already have a block for a keyword, you are not able to see what else is in the Block Directory, you only see what&#8217;s on yours. So we went through, and this is pretty normal for feature requests that you first kind of need an idea of clearly how to actually implement that. And so, I posted a few screenshots kind of mock-ups where I put the button, and there were some ideas, and then the designers chimed in and also had some ideas. They are a little bit more fancy with their mock-ups, and then there&#8217;s some discussion going on and more mock-ups when they&#8217;re there and then it stalls a bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last comment was September 2nd, and I started a couple of weeks ago to discuss it again, or just put another comment in there and, lo and behold, Kelly Dwan actually worked on something like that and already has a working design now, so this is cool. See, you can really influence how things are working when you are a little bit more engaged in the GitHub repository.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So these were quite a few examples on how someone who isn&#8217;t part of the developer team can contribute quite a bit to the development of WordPress. So, before you raise an issue, you might want to consider the following: isolate the issue to the core Block Editor, or plugin or the Gutenberg plugin. The icon that you see there is actually the icon of the health check and troubleshooting plugin which is fantastic to help you with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check that out, because it will allow you to switch on a site, it can be a production site, but because it&#8217;s your admin, only for you, you can switch up all plugins and all themes and just enable the Gutenberg plugin and already have a test site, and your visitors and your fellow editors will see your site like it was. So we&#8217;ll use that plugin quite a bit, but it might help you with this as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the next step would be to search on existing issues. You can use labels and keywords. As you saw, there are some labels for blocks and labels for features that you can drill down into the Gutenberg repository, and then use the bug report issue template and that has five components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is, put a description of what you find and that description should be concise, but also comprehensive, so you need to strike a balance there. But the more details you put already in the pros, the more someone who reads it can kind of put themselves into your shoes and figure out what might go wrong, and also where you&#8217;re coming from, what you&#8217;re trying to do and what you&#8217;ve found, and then list the steps to replicate the issue. In order to do this right, you actually need to know how that thing happens. What are the steps that got you to that? And that&#8217;s one of the most difficult things to actually nail down so somebody else can have the same experience, but it&#8217;s a critical thing. So others can also reproduce the problem and then they can decide where the attack vector is and where the code needs to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What of course always helps is a screenshot or a screencast and then it has another section there that&#8217;s the expected behavior. It helps really mentally after I go through the steps, okay, this is what happens, I try that too. So what is it exactly that the person expected to happen? And it helps to reiterate that and show how you think this can be best solved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the last part, the fifth part is, your environment information, what operating system you use, what browser you use, and which version. Also, if you use the WordPress core without the plugin, or a plugin, and the Gutenberg plugin and then also which version of the plugin. So when you go to the repository, and go to new issues and then click on bug report, that&#8217;s when you see the section&#8211;describe the bug, how to reproduce expected behavior screenshots and then the editor version, the desktop. And then, if you are on a smartphone, also what device and operating system and another iteration reports security issues not on GitHub, go to the WordPress hacker one program, report them there, because this is public information, and security issues should not be publicly disclosed before a fix is available. So this would be the plugin report issue template.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, so how do you get started? You need a WordPress or it&#8217;s just a checklist to make sure that you have everything. You need a wordpress.org account and the links pointed to the places where you can do that. You do need to create a GitHub account, and then you also need to create a WordPress Slack account, and then connect your WordPress profile to your GitHub account, that is so you get all the credits for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my profile I have here the GitHub account, when I go to edit profile I can revoke access. So there&#8217;s a GitHub username, and you should be logged in to both of them so you can directly connect the two. Jon Derosiers has also published a post on the core block about how that happened and all that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So after creating issues, the four variations, you can stop there. You can just do that all day long or once a week and nobody will tell you what to do. This is all self-motivated and self-driven. You probably are expected to actually answer some of the questions as they come up on the GitHub repository, there&#8217;s a notification set up, but what comes next? What could you do afterwards? So, the first one would be, check out the labor needs testing. What does it entail?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What does it entail &#8212; the needs testing? It would entail that you&#8217;d go to the issues, read the description and then go through the steps here, too, and figure out if you are also seeing the same occurrence. If you do, share your information, share that you can reproduce it so someone as a developer is more sure that that is actually what needs to be solved, it&#8217;s not caused by something else that&#8217;s an underlying issue or something like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could also participate in discussions. So, this is a fascinating place for me and I do productive procrastination on that quite a bit and fascinated by the discussions about possible solutions for a new feature or an enhancement. And sometimes that&#8217;s all that is in the discussions, but sometimes I actually have an opinion or a different idea and I share it, I chime in. And more often than not, my ideas might not make it into the final version of a new feature, but I always feel hurt that no aspects of my idea were considered, and I find great satisfaction with it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So an example could be improving the list block, so do we need more versions of that? And how those are going to be and any discussions like that, you don&#8217;t have to chime in, you just can read it, but I appreciate really how much thought in every issue goes and how many people have ideas or already have tested that, or have a working example implementation of that. Like here, Jeffrey Carandang has already something in his blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, it&#8217;s really interesting to read through some discussions and if you don&#8217;t have an opinion, you don&#8217;t have opinion, but sometimes you have, and this is a moment where you can actually be heard, have your opinions made known, even if it doesn&#8217;t turn out that way entirely, but you bring yourself in and the team is very patient, and it&#8217;s very considerate and very thoughtful about how to answer to some suggestions. So, it&#8217;s definitely another way to contribute, and you can join the triage team.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the triage team is an open group of people who label all the issues and shepherd them more or less through that process. You can read up about that on the contributor&#8217;s handbook. So that&#8217;s certainly another way to contribute and can join. You need additional permission to do that. And they tell you how, and follow that link, it shows you what is entailed on the Triage Team, and what the expectations are, and how they&#8217;ll meet and all that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if you need a broader focus on value working in a group on certain things, there is also the FSE means Full-Site-Editing Outreach Program, that&#8217;s run by Developer Relations Manager or Wrangler, Ann McCarthy. It&#8217;s geared towards people who build sites for others, but don&#8217;t write code. We get scripting tests for the author versions and then share our experience. You meet everyone in a separate Slack channel, it&#8217;s kind of a way to figure out if the people that would use it get everything they need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s about not only the site editing flow, do the interfaces make sense, or you&#8217;re getting confused? Do you know how to go from one section to the other section? But also, how would you migrate themes over to the new way to do this? Or can you mix and match the old way with the new way and all that kind of things will be discussed there. So it&#8217;s a small group and it&#8217;s an experiment, that&#8217;s the first outreach program that WordPress has, so it&#8217;s quite an interesting way to also contribute to really work on the bleeding edge of a great feature that will change how WordPress or how people interact with WordPress and build their sites, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s all I have for you today.

It looks more and more likely if the most popular ones remain bloated alternatives and the smaller ones keep on the same trajectory of attrition. It won’t happen overnight, but it is bound to accelerate when full-site editing makes its debut in WordPress core.&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Don&#8217;t just read the article, though.

It was a refreshing to hear Bill talk about the rich user experiences and the joy his customers gain from seeing the editor mirror their homepage exactly as it will be on the front-end and his goal to make that experience pixel perfect. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a developer or designer or agency owner this is definitely a podcast episode well worth listening to. </p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-upcoming-word-press-events\">Upcoming WordPress Events</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>January 19, 2021 6:30 PM&nbsp;to&nbsp;8:30 PM EST (23:30 UTC)</strong><br /><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/SF-WordPress-Users/events/275538774/\"><strong>WordPress &#8220;Mega Meetup&#8221;: The &#8220;New Year, New Stuff&#8221; Episode</strong></a><br />Four Speakers: Taco Verdonschot,  David Yarde, Gary Smith, Valerie Pierce</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>January 21, 2021 7:00 pm ET (00:00 UTC)</strong><br /><a href=\"https://burbswp.com/events/event/its-a-gutenberg-world/\"><strong>Philly &#8216;burbs WordPress Meetup &#8220;It’s a Gutenberg World&#8221;</strong></a><br />The local community will share their recommendations for a combined total of 10 blocks or block libraries. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>January 22, 2021 – 24-hour event</strong><br /><strong><a href=\"https://www.wordfest.live/register/\"><em>The</em>&nbsp;festival of WordPress – WordFest</a></strong><br />The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wordfest.live/schedule/\">sessions and schedule</a>&nbsp;are now posted.

My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack and I&#8217;m your host, and the curator of Gutenberg Times. Thank you all for watching, it&#8217;s great to have you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In today&#8217;s show, we will discuss The Making of the Post Open Source Better Solutions and more inclusive society that the content creators at Yoast and the techies put together. I&#8217;m extremely honored to have as guests three wonderful experts to discuss this and answer all your questions. We have Willemien Hallebeek, she&#8217;s the manager of content at Yoast. Hi, Willemien. How are you this evening?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Hi. I&#8217;m doing great. Thank you so much for having us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s awesome that you&#8217;re here and then I finally get to meet you. I read a lot of your content. We also have with us Anne McCarthy, developer relations wrangler at Automattic and on loan to the WordPress open source project. She&#8217;s also co-host of the show. Good afternoon, Anne. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Doing great. Thanks so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Awesome. And then, we have Omar Reiss, partner and CTO at Yoast. Hi, Omar. Welcome to the show. Thank you for all three of you, you&#8217;ve taken the time out of your day and be with us together. So how are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Great, great. Thank you so much for having us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Well, and welcome to Bob from Las Vegas. Who else is in there? Yeah, well, use the chat window to let us know more about you, dear listeners. Before we do proper introductions, in less than a minute, I hope, I have a few housekeeping notes and an announcement. This is going to be a mixed conversation, so we have demos, we have the questions that we have, and then we have your questions. If you have questions, please add them to the YouTube chat on the right, or use the Q&amp;A feature on the bottom of your screen to let us know your questions. We will give answers in between segments, so put them in here so they&#8217;re in the queue and we can get right to them. Feel free also to share your thoughts and comments in the chat, but please be kind, even if you disagree. This is a family-friendly endeavor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Announcement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we go into the deep weeds, and I have you here and your attention, State of the Word, the annual keynote by WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg is next week. Because WordCamp US was canceled, this is going to be a live stream event simultaneously streamed to the WordPress YouTube channel, the WordPress Facebook page, and the WordPress Twitter account. So mark your calendar. It&#8217;s on December 17th at 16:00 UTC. That is 11 a.m in Eastern, it&#8217;s 8 a.m Pacific, and it&#8217;s 5 o&#8217;clock Middle European time, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the Q&amp;A part of the live stream, and that&#8217;s something totally new, you can pre-record your question via a video. And a big emphasis on landscape format, not landscape, and send it before the event. Actually, the deadline for that is tomorrow, so you don&#8217;t have a whole lot of time left. Detailed instructions are in the news post on the WordPress.org, so go there. Yes, so that&#8217;s out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Introductions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m thrilled you&#8217;re all here. So let&#8217;s start. Omar, it&#8217;s been a while that we connected on WordCamp. I think we met in 2019 or so in &#8230; no, &#8217;18.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: In Nashville.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You&#8217;re a partner with Yoast, one of four, now six, I heard, or the border is now six, and you&#8217;re the chief technology officer. What exactly are you doing with Yoast? What&#8217;s your responsibility?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Well, yeah, I&#8217;m just in charge of everything that has to do with technology at Yoast. So the development teams, the QA teams, and the devops teams all report to me. I am also responsible for software architecture, so basically, the design of the code itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Interesting. Are you also going to fix my printer or you don&#8217;t have any printers anymore?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: No. That&#8217;s the only part of technology that I&#8217;m not responsible for at the Yoast. That&#8217;s part of the operations side of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. Well, thank you. Yoast is, after Automattic, the biggest corporate contributor to the open source project, WordPress open source project. How deep are you involved in this part of the Yoast team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Well, I&#8217;m starting to get quite involved again. The team is led by Francesca Morano, who you might know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I led a couple of WordPress releases. I think we have meetings every Tuesday where we discuss our efforts, and I&#8217;m generally present there. It kind of got the contributor virus reactivated, and I plan to work on some build tooling stuff for WordPress 5.7. So, yeah, ready to get back in the game.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay, excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne, we had many, many chats conversations on Slack about the various aspects of Gutenberg adoption events and the testing part of it. I&#8217;m so thrilled that you&#8217;re a co-host on the show today. You work as developer relations wrangler on loan through the WordPress project. What exactly do you do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: It&#8217;s a good question. I also just want to say it&#8217;s so awesome to actually be able to collaborate with you on this. I feel like we talk so much. It&#8217;s really, really an honor, so thank you for having me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I focus on the developer experience, whether that&#8217;s through creating better product feedback loops, through things like the full site outreach program, or calls for testing, trying to help get developers better connected both with each other and with the wider community and sharing resources. I helped kind of start a thing called Hallway Hangouts, which a bunch of people have done, which is super exciting. Trying to make it easier for new devs, that they&#8217;re first coming in to get acquainted with the community and get onboarded. So there&#8217;s been a couple different like documentation initiatives with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most recently, if you join co-editor for the first time, you&#8217;ll get a nice little Slack bot ping introducing you to things. So trying to be a bit creative there, especially while we can&#8217;t gather in person. And probably the last thing is just community-wide communication to get people excited about what&#8217;s happening with development and kind of just making it known in a way that&#8217;s user-focused and just builds excitement about the future of WordPress. So that&#8217;s kind of it in a nutshell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, but that&#8217;s a lot of work. I&#8217;m glad that you&#8217;re doing it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Willemien, it&#8217;s such a pleasure to meet you, manager of content. Knowing Yoast&#8217;s work in SEO, that sounds like a big job. What is it exactly that you do and how many people do you have doing it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Well, yeah, it&#8217;s a great job. It details a lot of content. Yoast.com has a lot of content. My main focus used to be on our blog, but since you&#8217;re short while, I&#8217;m also responsible for all the content on Yoast.com. That means we have a lot of help pages, feature pages, product pages. Well, I&#8217;m responsible for the entire thing, so make sure what&#8217;s created, and check the coherence and consistency of it. Because we&#8217;re growing, more people are working on our content, we want to prevent that we&#8217;re doing on one side something and on the other side the same thing. Yeah. It&#8217;s like the overview, overall responsibility of the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How many people? Yeah, that&#8217;s actually quite difficult. Well, I have three people in my blog team, well, we&#8217;re three actually; and three people from our academy team, they make our courses but also contribute a lot to the website; and then we have some people who actually work on the website but are not necessarily in my team, people creating content for our product pages, feature pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Who writes documentation at Yoast?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Documentation. I think &#8230; Omar, I think it&#8217;s Jimmy who writes for the dev portal documentation, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. Even Joost himself still writes a lot of documentation. Jono-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: &#8230; Jimmy. That&#8217;s a lot of development documentation and the support team does a lot of the help documentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I think the academy team recently rewrote a lot of the stuff as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Exactly, yeah. Yeah. We had a huge knowledge base, which was transformed to our help section of the site, and academy did a great job in making that very easy to understand for people. Because if you&#8217;re looking for a help article, it needs to be you know understandable for many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s not mainly the academy job. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It needs all the green lights on the Yoast plug-in, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Exactly, yeah. Yeah. We read all of that on our website. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Open-Source Story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So taking this open-source story that&#8217;s our topic today, as an example, so what&#8217;s your process from idea to publishing? What&#8217;s the genesis pretty much of that post on your site?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. The idea, I think Omar can tell that story best because he was there when the idea was born. I just took it on later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: You can tell something about the creation process that&#8217;s been mostly your job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Exactly. I can tell &#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: But let me give a brief, I think I was with Marieke at a WordCamp, Marieke, our CEO, and she gave a really great talk about gender stereotypes and prejudices. It&#8217;s a really, really nice talk. If you&#8217;re into diversity, I think it&#8217;s a really nice talk to also go look up on WordPress.tv. At Yoast, we&#8217;ve traditionally been really strong in our core values. We have a couple of things that are important to us, diversity is one, open source is another one. We have all these great stories that we tell on WordCamps, wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome to have these in a digital story format on Yoast.com as well, as really rich content that is dynamic and interactive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Gutenberg being present at the time, that was actually something that seemed really attainable. We basically said, &#8220;Let&#8217;s go. Let&#8217;s turn our important sort of core value stories that are close to our hearts. Let&#8217;s turn them into digital stories on Yoast.com and really give people something special. And then we turn to Willemien to create that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: That&#8217;s how that process goes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: And then I was involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: I got this idea, and then what we did was I started, first, we thought what do we want to tell people of course. And then I started gathering content we already had on our website, because we had some story, well, not stories, just more posts about why open source is great, or how to contribute. We had smaller parts of the story already on our website. I started gathering that and writing a complete story of it. We would really have a long read, and then I started thinking about what is a nice way to visualize this? We also had videos and we had a copy on some parts. I thought about a quiz for instance that we could add.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, that was just a big document actually with ideas and content, some links to videos and that went to our design department. They&#8217;ve created this awesome design of the page. They already kept in mind the blocks that were created previously for the prejudice story. Because they&#8217;ve kept that in mind, in fact, it was quite easy to create the content in the editor because the blocks were there, the content was there, and mainly, it was just on the getting it in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Making sure it all looks fine on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think it would be a good occasion here to have Omar kind of walk us through the back end, just scroll through the front end and then also through the back end of it and kind of talk about those segments. You can certainly, both of you kind of talk about things. What do you think?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Definitely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Let me show you the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Just for reference, I&#8217;ve also opened up the first one that we made, which is the &#8216;Gender, stereotypes and prejudice&#8217; one and you see that it&#8217;s also got animations; the open source one, we left it out for this time, but something that you can also do with Gutenberg, and I might show a little bit later. Basically, most of the stuff you see here, even this probably, it can be done with Gutenberg natively, which is really nice, even though, in our case, this table of contents is block, because we generated it with a special block, but we&#8217;ll show you about that later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: This was added later, right, Willemien?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Willemien Hallebeek: Yeah, it was added later. It was actually some feedback from Yoast. He thought, well, maybe we could have something at the beginning just making clear what you can find in the story. Because it&#8217;s a long story, so you want to take people by the hand and already give them some idea of what&#8217;s in it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. The funny thing is right at the start of the story you see this sort of card game where you can basically do sort of a quiz, where you can guess, so is this washing machine? Is it partly or created with the help of open source technology? And then you can guess like, &#8220;Well, no, it&#8217;s a washing machine, it&#8217;s not open source.&#8221; It&#8217;s like &#8230; no, oops.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I love this. I thought this was such a cool way to bring home the power of open source and engage with the page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. This part was really, because I thought, well, maybe people know some software is open source, but perhaps they don&#8217;t know washing machines can be open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: This kind of quiz sort of format we actually reused it from the stereotype where you have to choose if this is a stereotype or a prejudice. Basically, &#8220;This sentence, is it the prejudice?&#8221; And they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Yes, well done. It&#8217;s a prejudice because it makes a harmful judgment based ….&#8221; It&#8217;s the exact same kind of quiz format where you have to guess if it&#8217;s one or the other, but it&#8217;s a completely different game because this is aimed at understanding the difference between a stereotype and a prejudice. Here, it&#8217;s aimed at sort of simply guessing if open source is involved or not. You can even imagine a true or false game or whatever. There&#8217;s many different things that you could use this block for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the funny thing is that, like for instance, behind here, you can see a nice cover. That&#8217;s something that is just using Gutenberg natively. I&#8217;ll show you that in a minute. Yeah. So it&#8217;s got all kinds of this kind of interactive elements. You can see that there is a regular video here and that it has a sort of special functionality, that you can read also the transcript of that video. So it&#8217;s in there, if you want to read it; and if you want to hide it, you can hide it. So that makes it a really dynamic story. You can watch the video and it will tell you a little bit more, and then you continue farther into the story.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Like I said, most of what you can see here, you can do this in Gutenberg. There&#8217;s nothing needed to make this work. It&#8217;s just an image in a column block, and I will show you that later, which I think is amazing because what we set out to do &#8230; like, you have a couple of these examples of big publishers like the New York Times who creates these really compelling interactive digital stories. That&#8217;s really costly to do and they need designers and developers to make it. Basically, all of them have tried also turning that stuff into a framework that can be reused to create other stories. Well, basically, with Gutenberg, in a few blocks you have this framework. It&#8217;s really easy for anyone to sort of create this sort of rich, compelling content by themselves. It only requires a few blocks and a really nice book editor. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: That reminds me of the snow article from New York Times. I think Mel Choyce might have given a WordPress TV. I think it&#8217;s a WordPress TV talked about that, how you can recreate that in Gutenberg and how much it&#8217;s unlocked. It&#8217;s super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I&#8217;d love to see that talk. That&#8217;s exactly the kind of ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;ll get back on you when I find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: That&#8217;s exactly the kind of example that I was thinking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: It&#8217;s also the example that I gave I think about four years ago in the cafeteria of the Yoast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah, I remember.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I gave a presentation about digital storytelling and I gave that example as well. It&#8217;s like so cool what you could do. But it was so hard to make that at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: They spent months on that, right? It was a huge undertaking from them to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Exactly. You can see there&#8217;s some design things that are being reused. I&#8217;ll show you some examples from the other story as well what we did. Let me look if I can find another compelling block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the important. This &#8216;Thrive for the future&#8217; talk here, which is a talk by Joost and Marieke, and it&#8217;s been done in different forms also by Joost alone and he also did it together in a couple of occasions, which is really sort of our story about open source. That story sort of explained here in WordPress.tv, but then it&#8217;s also completely explained here in the whole &#8216;Tragedy of the commons&#8217; and how open source can help lead to a sort of reverse tragedy of the commons, and how can we get to a victory of the commons. Basically, the whole fight for the future thing in WordPress is explained and why it&#8217;s important. It&#8217;s a really important story for us and we really like to tell it. And you see the &#8216;Five for the Future&#8217; is explained here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right. Are these column blocks or are these media and text blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: We should watch it. Let&#8217;s briefly go to the back end to see what this looks like. Let&#8217;s first go to those blocks that we were just looking at. Yeah, we were looking at this one, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, they&#8217;re column blocks, yeah. Okay, got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: So these are column blocks. I think, just here, if you look at this, this is I think is a group block. No, that&#8217;s a column block, and then this is a group block, and then these are columns. It&#8217;s so incredible what you can just do with playing old Gutenberg right out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So that&#8217;s a gallery, I would assume, the pictures up there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Oh, yeah. We&#8217;re looking at this one. Which one did you say, gallery?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: The four pictures, kind of in the further up I think it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Oh, yeah. Right. So it seems like this is also a column block with multiple images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: And then to right below each other. This is a group.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: And you can see the structure here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s called the list view now. It was the block navigator. Just kind of a little tidbit here, we changed the interface, everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s been quite some interface changes, but fortunately, it all still works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I think a good thing to take a look at now is the how we use ACF. Because that&#8217;s made it so much easier to do this stuff, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Omar Reiss: We actually have a native table of contents block in Yoast SEO, but it doesn&#8217;t include this sort of image format. So if you go to that, you see these images that are in front of the table of contents and then basically the sub-headings. We created the sort of custom fields block for that where you can….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, okay, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reis</em>s: Yeah. Basically this is &#8230; I think it&#8217;s a repeater where you can have multiple links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: These are the three sections, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. The downside of this is that it&#8217;s not 100% what-you-see-is-what-you-get. But the upside of this is that it&#8217;s really easy to give rich elements, interactive elements and just fill them with the data and the content that&#8217;s needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, even more so with the quiz, I would think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reis</em>s: Definitely, this is a really good example. So this is the quiz. What I really find compelling about is that here you see there&#8217;s a Cover block, there&#8217;s a Group inside there with a Heading and a Paragraph, which is these two, and then the Yoast Stories Card Game and it all just seamlessly works together. I think it&#8217;s really miraculous how intuitive that is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So, in ACF, you create your field group, and then you tell in the field group that is for a block, and then you need to&#8230;?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. Let me show you the card game. Here, this is our field groups in ACF. Basically, what we did is we defined upfront what a card game is in terms of data. Here, we&#8217;ve defined that, we&#8217;re saying basically a card game is a repeater block and every sort of card game has its own image: Option A, Option B, Statement, and Explanation. Yeah, what you get here to put there. Basically, what ACF requires you to do to turn a sort of field group into a block is you need to register a template for that block, and then the template can use the fields. And then that&#8217;s basically how you can use it as a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: How quickly did you realize you needed to use ACF for this? Did you try to use Gutenberg first and then it was like, &#8220;This isn&#8217;t going to work, we have to switch over,&#8221; or did you live with this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: No. Basically, we knew that it wasn&#8217;t possible to do it with Gutenberg natively without coding a block so we would have to create a custom block. Then you can do it with ACF, which is really simple to do, especially if you have a little bit of development power. But anybody who&#8217;s able to create a WordPress theme or even tweak a WordPress theme could create an ACF block.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to create a custom sort of Javascript powered what-you-see-is-what-you-get block in Gutenberg, it&#8217;s much more work, basically. You have to completely think through the entire interface of how to interact with that. Yeah, it&#8217;s really not trivial to do, especially if you want to make something dynamic and interactive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Have you tried any other of the non-Javascript block builders like Block Lab that&#8217;s now Genesis Blocks Pro, I think it&#8217;s called, the other one is called Lazy Blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I haven&#8217;t tried those yet. But I have created a lot of custom blocks sort of from scratch. Also, Yoast SEO has got a couple of ones. So we are definitely familiar with how to create native blocks, so to speak. But I haven&#8217;t tried the other sort of custom block solutions that are out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I did a few months back, maybe a year and a half ago, kind of a summary on that, on the W Tavern from creating blocks without Javascript and comparing all three of them. I&#8217;m going to try if I can grab that and share it in a bit. Yeah. Oh, and then you wanted to show us the video, the special features?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Video data in ACF Block</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Omar Reiss: Yeah. I just wanted to show you this example because I think it would have been nice to create this as a native block, because this is a video. A video is something that the Gutenberg Editor actually knows how to do. But then again, because we also wanted to have a transcript, we sort of took a shortcut. And it was just the easiest thing to do this in an ACF block because I would only have to worry about the template. Well, it kind of works, but then again, this would not have been hard to do more natively. Maybe if we put in like two hours extra, then this could have been a nicer, better experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, I&#8217;m always on the impression, if it works, why change it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s true as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: It also adds a nice experience for people who are building the content to kind of prime them to include a transcript, which I think on the content side I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s also helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yes, it&#8217;s absolutely helpful. Yeah. Because not everybody can listen to audio on their computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah, exactly. That&#8217;s why these are added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I think I&#8217;d like to show &#8230; Oh, sorry?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: I just want to say we added them to these two videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m just making a call for our audience here. If you have any questions to Willemien and Omar, please use the Q&amp;A on the bottom of the screen and then we can kind of read them here for both of them to answer. Just not seeing any, so I think I need to coax a little bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Won&#8217;t you pull up the animations? I know, Omar, you said you might show how that&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Animations</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Wanted to show you is there&#8217;s two things about this post that I really like, that I also wanted to showcase, because it shows a little bit more what&#8217;s possible even. All of these animations are powered by a library called Lottie. Lottie is basically a Javascript library that allows you to animate SVGs in a certain format. If you use I think Adobe, some kind of Adobe product, it&#8217;s really easy to make those animations with Lottie. It&#8217;s a library by Airbnb. Basically, what I did is I included Lottie with Yoast.com. So it now comes with Yoast.com and you can now directly export these sort of animated SVGs from Adobe and upload them to Yoast.com and use them in any content, basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this was an experiment to do that. I think it&#8217;s really cool that sort of Yoast.com now by default supports these animations in the block editor. I actually got it to work &#8230; Let me, this is going to be a live demo risk, but I&#8217;m still going to take it. Let me see. I think they work also in the editor themselves, which I was like, you know, my nerd heart beating….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I have one of those moments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. So because I want, when I upload those images, and I hope I can find an example, yeah &#8230; that I can see them animate in the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Wow, that&#8217;s really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: That would be the magic moment for me. That, I got to work so. Yeah, that was a really big, big victory and a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Do you share how you&#8217;re doing it all? Have you all written up like the process you went through, to integrate the library?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah, actually I think I do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: That would be super cool to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. Frontliners &#8230;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;m glad we all Google the same way for things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. I wrote this post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: But Yoast app just wouldn&#8217;t be showing up in Google.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: In 2020, I wrote this post &#8216;Digital storytelling in the age of blocks&#8217; where I explained every step and, basically, the basics just use the block editor. I also show how we did a lot of the stuff and also the templating and stuff. Because one of the things that I was excited about, and I also show in this post, is that we actually use the Yoast FAQ block. Let me try to find it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m glad you mentioned that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Here, in this post, this is just the Yoast FAQ block. You can see that this &#8220;Are men smarter than women?&#8221; This format is not what you see on the front end because what you see on the front end is this, it&#8217;s where the answer is actually hidden and these prejudices are shown. And then you sort of first get to think about it and then you show the answer and you hopefully get confronted with something to think about even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I did is on the front end I filtered the blocks, the Yoast FAQ block, and came up with a different representation of the same block, which sort of turned it a little bit in this game format. It&#8217;s just one other example of how incredibly flexible the block editor is and blocks are to use to your advantage. I thought it was really compelling, nice example of how we can reuse an existing block actually made by a plugin in our, in this case, our plugin. But, yeah, that was really exciting for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of demo, I think that&#8217;s the most important thing. Is there anything you would like me to showcase or show?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, ask the people in the audience I think &#8230; well, we certainly have a few questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;m also happy to jump in with some too because this has been really fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: When do you decide between kind of using something like ACF or do you want to do custom build blocks. It&#8217;s certainly one that I&#8217;m always struggling with. Also, what does Willemien think about ACF versus a custom-built block and all that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Well, yeah, I&#8217;m really the least technical person here. Awesome. I think that the nice thing is if you really use block &#8230; for us, it&#8217;s mostly important that you can see what you get. So, yeah, if it gets closest to that, if you&#8217;re creating the content in the back end, it&#8217;s just so nice that you don&#8217;t have to switch all the time between preview and go back to the editor and doesn&#8217;t really look like what you want to. Yeah, that&#8217;s mainly ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. That&#8217;s a very important one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: I think, well, it&#8217;s just nice to see, to do most stuff in the editor whenever it&#8217;s possible, what Omar said as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: And if-</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Go ahead, Omar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: No, I just want to share, if anybody wants to see anything, I can always share again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haac</em>k: Yeah, sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: But I like to see you large as well, so that&#8217;s right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I think it&#8217;s important to, what you say, Willemien, in terms of, well, on that blog or post, you only had maybe three videos in ACF and that quiz, but when you look at larger publishers’ websites, yeah, I went to the WordCamp for publishers and one of the speakers showed nine pages of ACF fields with all kinds of different data. But only when you hit Preview, you were able to actually see what you put where and where it will show up. I think that what you see is what you get is really important. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. It makes our job a lot easier, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I totally agree with the long list of ACF that is not a great user experience. We&#8217;ve created a couple of dynamic blocks because this is what we&#8217;re talking about. Basically, blocks that are rendered in the PHP via a template, that&#8217;s very easy to create.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I think I prefer in those blocks and maybe the other examples that you gave just now Birgit. It more like that is where you have sort of the server-side render component in the editor where you actually see what is being rendered in the editor. And you do the editing in the sidebar and then, on mobile, this is not the best experience maybe, but it&#8217;s a really nice experience on desktop where you can actually see what you&#8217;re editing. That might be a good middle ground. But generally the reason why we chose ACF blocks for this kind of stuff is just also cost. A cost reason because it&#8217;s just you know it&#8217;s really easy, much easier to do and cheaper.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah. Quickly, there&#8217;s an attendee question that we can answer. The question&#8217;s anonymous and it&#8217;s, &#8220;How About Site Speed in such long stories? Were there any measurements done in terms of site speed both front-end and back end good question yes thank you well a really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good question, thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Well, it&#8217;s a really good question. I remember having the question the first time, I don&#8217;t know, did you look at site speed for the open source post that we did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: We did. After we posted it, we checked it. We found out we could improve some images so we really we turned them all into png to make sure they can be with clouds there. They now are transferred, they&#8217;re now made into a web pea and I think that&#8217;s the fastest way and to make them as small as possible actually I think there are also Lazy Loaded now, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. I think yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: When you scroll….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. Lazy Loading. I don&#8217;t know about the animations and those are actually ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: SVGs, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: So the animated image, I remember also looking at that, they&#8217;re not very big but there are a lot of them on the page. I think in the end we also &#8230; but I should check if that if that indeed works. But I think we also managed to lazily load those SVGs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s always a little bit of a technical, so what&#8217;s speed and what&#8217;s perceived speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So as soon as I can read something very quickly, yeah, I don&#8217;t care that much how long it takes that what I&#8217;m not who I&#8217;m not scrolling to is not there. Yet, yes, it kind of comes back comes later so I think that &#8230; have you done any measurements in that regard or optimized your site like the text is not, that the site doesn&#8217;t have to be fully built to show people something, or fully rendered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I think the main thing that we lazily load is the images. So those are not rendered on page. But all the rest is entirely cached in CloudFlare, so generally Yoast.com pages, even bigger pages are really quite fast to load because they&#8217;re completely cached and nothing has to be sort of made ready to download before it can come to your browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. It&#8217;s definitely something to keep in mind when you create a story like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So does that answer the question of Anonymous? All right. Yes. Okay, good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had also a question that we put together. Now that it&#8217;s out there and how you built it, if you had it to do all over again, would you do anything differently or what is it to improve?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: I can&#8217;t tell, but after looking again at the other story, I just really regret that we didn&#8217;t add more animations in it. Yeah, because they mostly make it just more fun to watch, more dynamic. But they also take more time to be created, to be developed. So, it&#8217;s kind of the&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: The victory of the commons, I feel like that could have been really cool, like people cycling together kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: The animations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: And you can make it alive, right? Yeah. There&#8217;s lots of ideas, right? We are actually planning on another big one. I think it&#8217;s coming out in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah, Schema.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss:</em> It&#8217;s a big one on Schema. But the idea from the start was to have a framework and to improve on it. Basically, we wanted to just see how difficult is it to create a framework for digital storytelling now that we have this awesome block editor. I think the experience with this second post, the second story, was that it really didn&#8217;t require a lot of extra work to build it technically. We got a new table of contents idea there and it was built by a front end there. It was added to what we had already and mostly we could build with the building blocks that we had. I do think that it would be nice to explore the other options, for instance, that you shared, I think Atomic Blocks, is that the one??</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Atomic Blocks. Yeah. You mean not using Javascript but a templating thing for that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: One is the Genesis Blocks actually, which is the Block Lab out of Australia, was bought by WP Engines, and they are now Genesis Blocks Pro I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Right. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: They have a free version in the repository. That was actually quite powerful. Actually, when I scrolled through this and now listening to you, have you thought about would it be even faster to put together if you had section block patterns instead of kind of having, yeah, together three &#8230; I can see that the columns block was the group block with a different background and with the different images in there take actually quite a bit to put together from scratch. If you had a block pattern then you could just kind of pull it in and say, &#8220;Okay. I have these two guys to the right with text and then in the middle column and just kind of pull it in with the background.” Yeah. Have you thought about doing that and kind of improving on your framework?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah, definitely. I haven&#8217;t thought about it yet, but it sounds like a great idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. It sounds like a dream for a content editor to be able to drag it in. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I made a site recently and I did something like that with some patterns where at first I was like manually copying-pasting, removing the stuff I didn&#8217;t want and all of a sudden I was like, &#8220;Wait a second. I can just have a pattern, have it ago, and just plug and play,&#8221; so for content, it&#8217;s amazing, especially&#8230;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Did you need to do any development for that or is it something that you can do as a content editor?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: No. I did it just on the side. A lot of it was done, for this site in particular, I did it on WordPress.com which has come in with built-in like I think 117 block patterns. So this was just kind of like a for fun. I have a lot of for fun sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: But it was kind of showing the future where we&#8217;re going to go. I&#8217;ll link to the WordPress.com pattern library.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s pretty cool. Well, there is a plugin out there by JB Audras where you can actually convert your reusable blocks to block patterns, kind of get over that problem that if you change reusable blocks you change it on all of them instead of using it as a template. Here, in his plugin, he has a feature where you can actually transfer it. And then there&#8217;s another plugin out there called Block Pattern Builder and the author is Blockmeister. They also let you kind of highlight a block and then have a menu in the more options block save as a block pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So content creators can at least start out with that. And if you need them tweaking you can hand it to your designer because it&#8217;s pretty much templating, yeah, that can be added to theme. Yeah. There is a resource list of all the things Block Patterns on the Gutenberg Times. I think it was the second last post that I did and it has a lot of additional ideas on themes that have come with Block Patterns. So it&#8217;s definitely something to take a look at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Did you all explore or have you looked into Google&#8217;s web stories plugin? Because I feel like they&#8217;re trying to accomplish a similar thing. I haven&#8217;t played around with it yet though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. We&#8217;re actually experimenting a bit with that as well. It was really nice that we got a tweet from someone who is also working on the web stories and he contacted us saying, &#8220;Well, this is actually&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Perfect use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. This would be a perfect web story. Definitely, I think we&#8217;re now in the process of getting it on Yoast.com. We really want to start creating some web stories. Well, I don&#8217;t know if we&#8217;re going to choose this topic or another one, but yeah, definitely, something we&#8217;d like to &#8230; it will be like, yeah, we have to play around with it and see what we can make with. It might be a bit you know shorter I think. The content needs to be even more snackable than what we have here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Do you struggle with that at all, of trying to make something snackable like you said versus like a long form, or have you intentionally gone more long form with this stuff?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. I think it&#8217;s intentionally more long form because &#8230; yeah. We really want to tell the story well and otherwise it gets &#8230; snackable, is nice but this is something like maybe elaborate a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;m all for long form, so you can consider me a fan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Me too. Me too. But I liked how you broke it up. Yeah. So it&#8217;s kind of snackable to kind of come back and say okay yeah this is the topic and then they have bullet lists and not this wall of text that others have. So you kind of really &#8230; yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: The best of both worlds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Both worlds, yeah. Yeah, and having a good designer as well, with the iconography. Even if it&#8217;s just a non-animated thing, it still kind of breaks up the text so much. Yeah. My favorite block right now is the media and text block because the image can change the size of it, depending on the text. So you can fill the full bleed of the column with an image and then you have the text next to it. So I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: So it&#8217;s dynamic to the amount of text you ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So if you have a long picture, you don&#8217;t need to have long text to go with it there. You can say crop it to the text size and that&#8217;s really good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So use it a bit more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s why I was asking are these columns or are these media and text blocks at the beginning. And I can see that columns from the idea is really easy to grasp, &#8220;Okay. I have two columns, three columns, four columns,&#8221; but then, yeah, so I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, yeah, so we don&#8217;t have any more audience questions. Do you have any more questions, Anne, that you want to ask them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;d love to know if you have any more stories coming up, just like content wise? Is there another WordPress related open source maybe inspired story that you all are trying to tell, like a next version because these are the next things we we&#8217;re going to get into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: We wanted to build the next story on Schema and structured data. So that will be coming out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There&#8217;s a there&#8217;s a lot of things to do: that&#8217;s reviews, it&#8217;s recipes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Oh, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Also, just the higher level, philosophically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. I think we will be….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: It&#8217;s super interesting. It&#8217;s basically the story of open data and of the sort of evolution of the web. Yeah. So that&#8217;s also something near and dear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So you&#8217;re going back to Adam and Eve, practically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. I&#8217;m not sure if you go back that far, but &#8230; No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s not your fault, that&#8217;s 2000 years. Yeah. Andrea had a question here from the audience, &#8220;Based on your experience working in the block editor for complex posts like this, is there a particular request you&#8217;d like to make to the team working on Gutenberg?&#8221; Apart from switching off the full screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I&#8217;m leaving it to our competitor, but otherwise &#8230; I also have a request, but I think it&#8217;s already on the roadmap.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Okay. Yeah. That&#8217;s a hard question. Yeah. Well, let me think about it. Yeah. Maybe we have to add some help from front end, making tweaks to headings and stuff to be able to move them easily. I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s something ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, drag-and-drop is a big thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Oh, maybe the alignment, kind of full width.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Alignment option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah, alignment options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Do you want to control line heights as well?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Sometimes it&#8217;s something a little bit too compressed and if you have more line height, control ….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Sometimes you might have like a heading in the design, which I think it&#8217;s probably already possible where you have a relatively small heading, but you need a bigger heading level. That&#8217;s probably already possible. I can almost not imagine that to be a problem today. I know you have a font size. You have a font size.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, there&#8217;s a font size. I regularly mess with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Well, the heading, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah. I would personally really, really like collaborative editing features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: It would make me completely skip Google Docs in writing. I really like collaborative editing personally for whatever I do. It&#8217;s not for everyone maybe, but especially the commenting part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I don&#8217;t need to be in the same document with someone necessarily, but I would really like some editorial workflows where you can comment on stuff and give suggestions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. Skip the heading part, focus on that, that&#8217;s better, that&#8217;s the best idea, definitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. What I struggle with is that, if I have an older post yeah and when I edit it I have to kind of copy it somewhere else, edit it, and then get it back because I cannot finish it in one session. And I cannot schedule these revisions, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And that&#8217;s kind of one thing, but, yeah, collaboration is on the roadmap. You&#8217;re right, Omar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I just dropped a link to something Riad had experimented with. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Riad had experimented with it, yeah. Quite, quite a bit actually here. Site up there it&#8217;s called Asblocks.com, but it&#8217;s on the roadmap for the next phase. So, I think 2023 or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Or 22, yeah. I think &#8217;21 is already over and I&#8217;m thinking &#8217;22, but that&#8217;s not right. That&#8217;s not right. &#8217;20 is almost over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: We&#8217;re still just trying to get through 2020. I mean, I think there&#8217;s also already a plug-in offering it. And yeah, and I really reapps work on this as well. I remember when he tweeted his AS blocks out, it&#8217;s, yeah, good to be reminded of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: But it&#8217;s just so exciting. I want to see it. Also, we will probably utilize it if we have something like that in Yoast SEO. We can imagine using a sort of commenting system to give inline feedback really granularly. That I think could turn into a really amazing experience where you sort of enable sort of SEO mode and you get really granular SEO comments sort of automated editorial workflows, that kind of stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Really promising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: We already have the readability analysis that says, &#8220;Your sentences are too long.&#8221; So if you could get this kind of feedback on a more granular level that would be super helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Andrea, you indeed specialize in hard questions, that&#8217;s okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: It&#8217;s really cool to see you also like the collaborative editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So much, yeah. So we are at the end of our show. I could probably talk with you another two more hours, but I want to, yeah, let you go. And we probably can do this again. Thank you for the questions from the audience. At this point, I have two more questions for you, all three of you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you have any announcements that you couldn&#8217;t get to talk about before, what you want people to keep in mind? If people want to get in touch with you, what would be the best way? Willemein, do you want to start?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. I don&#8217;t really have any announcements I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Which is fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah. Well, you can find me on Twitter and reach out to me on willemien@yoast.com.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Via email, yeah, cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Yeah, the best, fastest way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Omar?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: The best way to reach me is either Twitter @OmarReiss or on the WordPress Slack where I typically respond quite fast. No announcements here either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: No announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: I would like to say that I really enjoyed this webinar, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. We enjoyed having you, of course. Anne?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I actually do have some announcements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: There&#8217;s a great post speaking of kind of the phases of the core editor. Matias just posted a really awesome update kind of showing what&#8217;s happening with editing. I think it&#8217;s really worth reading through and kind of getting excited about it. I read through it and just kind of had my brain exploding with ideas and hopefully it does the same for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also just want to give a big props to the 5.16 that release just came out this week. It was the first women in non-binary-led release for WordPress, which feels pretty historic. So I just want to like shout that out and major props to everyone involved in that effort.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then, for keeping in touch. I&#8217;m a weird millennial who doesn&#8217;t like social media, but I blog at nomad.blog and you can find me on WordPress.org slack as annezazu. Feel free to reach out to me either place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: All right. And that&#8217;s it. Big thank you to the viewers. Big thank you to you for being here. You can reach out to me on twitter or on the WordPress Slack. You could also send emails to <a href=\"mailto:pauli@gutenbergtimes.com\">pauli@gutenbergtimes.com</a>, a recording of this will be available in a few minutes on YouTube and I&#8217;ll share it of course also with a panelist, so you can share it, but also over the social media. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it was a joy talking to you. Yeah. I wish everybody wonderful holidays. Happy Hanukkah to Israel and the Jewish community Merry Christmas and happy holiday. This is also the last show of the year from Gutenberg Times we won&#8217;t have a Changelog because the team. We always do a Changelog podcast after the release and the release moved a week into my holiday or into my vacation time, so we will be back January 8th with a Changelog and we will cover two Gutenberg releases. And so, that&#8217;s my announcement. I wish you all yeah good evening, a nice afternoon, and thank you for watching and being with me here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Willemien Hallebeek</em>: Thanks so much, Brigit. This was wonderful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Omar Reiss</em>: Thank you so much. It was a pleasure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Resources mentioned </h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://yoast.com/open-source-story/\">Open source: Better solutions and a more inclusive society</a></li><li><a href=\"https://yoast.com/gender-stereotypes-prejudice-sociology/\">Gender, stereotypes and prejudice; a sociological exploration</a></li><li><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/block-building-without-javascript-testing-acf-block-lab-and-lazy-blocks\">Block Building with our JavaScript </a>by Birgit Pauli-Haack at WPTavern </li><li><a href=\"https://airbnb.io/lottie/#/\">Lottie library</a> (Animation)</li><li><a href=\"https://developer.yoast.com/blog/digital-storytelling-in-the-age-of-blocks/\">Digital storytelling in the age of blocks</a></li><li><a href=\"https://wordpress.com/blog/2020/10/28/introducing-patterns/\">Introducing Patterns: Prebuilt Blocks for Beautifully Designed Websites</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/the-wordpress-block-patterns-resource-list/\">The WordPress Block Patterns Resource List</a></li><li><a href=\"https://asblocks.com/\">AsBlocks</a> &#8211; end-to-end encrypted (private) collaborative writing environment</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=5ejk24_XWeI&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa0Y1dDBNc1FuZzgxbjN4Q0hfb3hqeFRZMmZlUXxBQ3Jtc0tsNnYxN1I5WVBfeEtfX1pOLUx3eEplSW1PWk95ZG5GbmlweFN2SkVCUmxQY3NackM1Zk9mNDZ5alhnRHFScFJmLVgwaWtkYm1jR2dIQTRWaVYtd0k2S0w0YUpaR0l4U2Iwb25SNmNqS2hLY2lsTXZ2WQ%3D%3D&event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.org%2Fplugins%2Fcommenting-feature%2F\">Google Doc-Style Editorial Commenting for WordPress</a></li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/12/10/status-check-site-editing-and-customization/\">Status Check: Site Editing and Customization by Matias Ventura (Core Team) </a></li></ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:39;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Gutenberg Times: Weekend Edition #153 Query-Block, Page Builders, Site Editor and more\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=16345\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/weekend-edition-153-query-block-page-builders-site-editor-and-more/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14149:\"<p>Howdy,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s been a while!

They also cover the aspect that Gutenberg can be integrated into non-WordPress sites and CMS. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt said: <em>&#8220;(&#8230;) We’re actually re-licensing Gutenberg to the MPL, which is the<a href=\"https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/\"> Mozilla Public License</a> to allow it to be used in proprietary mobile apps.

The team is preparing this year&#8217;s default theme, Twenty-Twenty One, for the release of the full-site editing experience in 2021. You can find it in the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/theme-experiments\">Theme Experiments</a> Repo on GitHub. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>To use the theme yourself you need to install the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg/\">Gutenberg plugin</a>, and the full-site-editing experience will be available to you after activating the TT1-Blocks theme or any other block-based themes from the themes-experiments. </p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-color has-background has-small-font-size\">&#8220;Warning: Full Site Editing is an experimental feature and potential API changes are to be expected!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The full-site experience comprises the Site-Editor, Navigation  &amp; Widget Screens and Global Styles sidebar. You can read about the current status of development of each part in Matias Ventura&#8217;s post <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/12/10/status-check-site-editing-and-customization/\"><strong>Status Check: Site Editing and Customization</strong></a> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also want to point out that the speed in which Joen change screens and reloads his updates seems a wee bit faster than in real life. It will depend heavily on the oomph of your server and Internet speed how fast you can navigate and change settings on the editor. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first feature, Joen points out is the <strong>Query Block</strong>, a feature rich block for the Loop &#8211; a list of posts or pages or other content types, displayed on the homepage or on archive pages. The already available &#8220;Latest post&#8221; block is its first iteration. The query block will give users and theme developers alike great flexibility with an easy integration and customization process. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without knowing the technical terms, you can change the Site Title, the Navigation and the tagline right from the Site Editor screen. Use the <strong>Block List View</strong> to orient yourself and jump directly to the various sections of your site. Behind the scenes, the <strong>Site Editor Engine</strong> keeps track of all your edits, displays them in a sidebar overview and save the various parts and template at the right places. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can pull into the Site-Editor any kind of template, Joen mentions the default error handling page (also 404-page), and modify it with existing blocks and familiar tools. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a Theme&#8217;s <strong>block patterns</strong>, you should have a set of ready-made templates you can add to your site&#8217;s footer or pages for various display options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <strong>Global Styles</strong> controls in the sidebar of the site editor allow you to make decision on the color palette of your site and you can review your pages and posts on how they change the design on the fly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After watching this demo, I can only echo Matt&#8217;s &#8220;(&#8230;) We&#8217;ve come a long, long way with Gutenberg from those first versions you might&#8217;ve seen and tried out. If you haven&#8217;t given a try recently, I encourage you to check out Gutenberg.&#8221; I have been following the project with you here on the Gutenberg Times for the last three years and I can still get excited about the new features the team adds to the editor to make it a tool of creativity on the web. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Live Q &amp; A: WordPress Site-Editor (TNG)  Jan 28, 2020</h2>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Ari Stathopoulos</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Carolina Nymark</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image\"><img />Anne McCarthy</div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In our next Live Q &amp; A</strong>, we will have <strong>Carolina Nymark</strong> back, our resident expert on Full-site Editing as well as <strong>Ari Stathopoulos</strong>, Core Contributor and who  landed the first block-based theme, Q,  in the repository and <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong>, who runs the Full-Site editing outreach program.

We have Joen showing the site editor beta.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Joen Asmussen:&nbsp; In this demo, I&#8217;d like to walk you through the new Gutenberg site editor. The site editor allows you to edit the theme templates beyond the post content. It introduces several new blocks like the query loop. When you make a modification like adding a featured image, it naturally adds it to every post in the query. You can configure the layout, make simple tweaks, and it propagates to all the posts. If you prefer the featured image above the titles, no problem. All the familiar block interactions are available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the header is a separate template part, it could be edited seamlessly. Everything is a block, navigation, the site title, the tagline, making it easy to edit anything and make use of all the block tools available. The block list view shows all the different areas like header and footer for quick access. Since everything is created with blocks, it&#8217;s easy to edit. The site editor engine keeps track of all the modifications, giving the user a clear overview of what has been modified. The site title, the header area, etcetera. You can open the 404 template, modify it like any other content. With the introduction of block patterns to WordPress, themes will be able to offer any number of designs, providing a shortcut to replicating demo sites or swapping out aspects users may not like with another that they do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the culmination of several ongoing projects to improve and expand upon the customization possibilities in WordPress. Both templates and regular pages can be edited in the site editor. Small previews can be seen when hovering the different templates. The style customization panel allows making global changes like text, link, or background color. These modifications can be quickly checked against the different pages in the site. You can customize any template of the site, such as the page template. Drag and drop the page title into a cover block to use a gradient for that page. The possibilities are endless. We can&#8217;t wait to see what you build with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg: As you can see, we&#8217;ve come a long, long way with Gutenberg from those first versions you might&#8217;ve seen and tried out. If you haven&#8217;t given a try recently, I encourage you to check out Gutenberg. By creating this common framework that every theme and plugin can build on we&#8217;re reducing the Balkanization within WordPress from people who are solving these problems lots of different ways, and providing what I believe is the basis for the next decade of WordPress&#8217;s growth. So we&#8217;re about two years into a 10 year project. We&#8217;ve got good chunks of phase one and phase two of Gutenberg done. That&#8217;s the post and page editing and then editing the entire site. I&#8217;m excited to continue these in 2021 and hopefully start to get to phases three and four.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 18:15:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Birgit Pauli-Haack\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:105:\"Gutenberg Times: Weekend Edition #152-Block-Based Themes, G2 Components, Block Pattern Directory and more\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=16062\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/weekend-edition-152-block-pattern-directory/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13491:\"<p>Happy Holidays! </p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s almost there, in less than two weeks, we leave 2020 behind us and start the New Year!

This year it was <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2020/12/17/matt-mullenweg-2020-state-of-the-word/\">a short sweet 26 minutes keynote by Matt Mullenweg</a> with appearances of Joen Asmussen demoing the Site Editor and Josepha Haden introducing successful businesses that started because of the pandemic. &#8220;When online is your only options, WordPress is your best option&#8221;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2020/12/17/matt-mullenweg-2020-state-of-the-word-qa/\">Question &amp; Answer session</a> was also different: WordPress Community members were asked to send in their questions via video, and instead answering all the questions himself, Matt deferred to other members on the WordPress teams. It was high diversity crowd coming together. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sarah Gooding</strong> wrote a <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/state-of-the-word-2020-wordpress-moves-toward-full-site-editing\">full recap for the WPTavern</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>David Bisset</strong> also posted an <a href=\"https://mailchi.mp/poststatus/426?e=e31bffca27\">excellent summary with some background information on the Post Status</a> newsletter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here on the <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/site-editor-demo-sotw/\">Gutenberg Times</a>, I was most intrigued by the demo of the beta version of the Site-Editor by Joen Asmussen. <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/site-editor-demo-sotw/\">You can read all about here.</a></p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learn.WordPress</strong> was officially launched with over 30 Workshops and Discussion groups. Let Hugh Lashbrooke <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/introducing-learn-wordpress/\">introduce you to the new program</a>. We have a  <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/block-editor-workshops-wordpress/\">list of Block Editor Workshops</a>, for beginners and advanced content creators and developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/g2-components-a-from-scratch-reimagining-of-wordpress-components?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=g2-components-a-from-scratch-reimagining-of-wordpress-components\">G2 Components, a From-Scratch Reimagining of WordPress Components</a> (WPTavern) <br /><strong>Justin Tadlock</strong> wrote about  Jon Quach&#8217;s new component design system, G2 Components, that has been in the works for the last six months. It&#8217;s about to start bleeding into the Gutenberg @wordpress/components script, with switching out the base components one at a time, without breaking 3rd party developers plugins. At least that&#8217;s the idea of it. Jon and the Gutenberg team is carefully walking the backwards compatibility line. The developer experience around the block-editor will get a major upgrade once the G2 components are successfully integrated. They will not only be available for the block-editor but of other wp-admin interfaces as well. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Block-based Themes (aka Full-Site-Editing)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jump-start-block-based-theme-development-with-the-fse-theme-generator\">How to use the scaffolding script to start your new block-based theme</a>, is the topic of <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/jump-start-block-based-theme-development-with-the-fse-theme-generator\">this article </a>in the WPTavern by Justin Tadlock. He walks you how to get started and then use the Gutenberg site-editor to finish the theme. It&#8217;s a bar bones theme, of course, a fresh canvas for designers. Justin then digs into the various pieces of the generated theme. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Carolina Nymark</strong>, contributor to the Themes team and educator at <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com\">full-site-editing.com</a>, started the &#8220;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2020/12/14/discussion-requirements-for-full-site-editing-themes/\">Discussion: Requirements for full site editing themes</a>&#8221; for themes to be approved to the official Themes repository on WordPress.org. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ernesto Mendez</strong> wrote Part II in ThemeShaper&#8217;s series of <a href=\"https://themeshaper.com/2020/12/18/getting-started-with-block-themes-templates/\">Getting Started with Block Themes on Templates</a>. He explained: &#8220;In the classic way of theming, we usually have functions that give us the different parts that make up a post, such as&nbsp;<code>the_title()</code>,&nbsp;<code>the_content()</code>, and so on. Block themes give us the same features using blocks directly!&#8221;. Ernesto also shared shared more about the difference between a classic WordPress theme and a block-based one and walks you through creation, saving and editing of the various pieces. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wptavern.com/help-steer-the-future-of-wordpress-via-the-fse-outreach-program\">Help Steer the Future of WordPress via the FSE Outreach Program</a> &#8220;The official launch of the program should coincide with the release of Gutenberg 9.6, which is expected to ship within the next week.

He keeps us updated on the latest discussions and issues that can use your input. Also, his list of Overview Issues and Resources is a treasure chest. <br />I just discovered an article I missed in by Ari Stathopoulos: &#8220;<a href=\"https://wp.me/p29gdg-4MC\">Printing navigation-block HTML from a legacy menu in themes</a>&#8221; Something really helpful when you might need to migrate a site from a classic theme to a block-based theme.

You can follow along on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory\">GitHub repository</a> and its <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/projects/1\">project board for the initial version</a>. Similar to the Block-directory, there are a few moving pieces that need to fit together: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/11\">The website of the Pattern Directory for WordPress.org</a>, similar to on the plugin and themes directories. </li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/10\">Pattern Directory support in the core editor</a> so users can search and insert block patterns directory from the inserter, similar to the block directory, without the installation steps. Patterns probably can be directly added to the post or page from the directory. </li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/9\">Pattern Submission Tool</a> &#8211; based on the editor with sidebar controls and metadata entry. This will include <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/22\">a validation and curation step</a> before the submitted pattern is published. You can also follow along the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/9#issuecomment-724362494\">first designs by Michael Arestad</a>. This is probably the most exciting part of the new directory as it will accommodate the community&#8217;s creativity. </li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/8\">Pattern Directory API for the backend of the site</a></li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/3\">REST-API end-point</a>, and </li><li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/pattern-directory/issues/30\">new Pattern CPT permissions for creation and editing</a> </li></ul>\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Developing for the Block Editor</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Ronald Huereca</strong> published a 12 part series on <a href=\"https://wpandajax.com/series/building-a-gutenberg-sidebar/\">&#8220;Creating a Gutenberg Sidebar&#8221;</a> plugin.

A big Thank You to Anne McCarthy, who joined me as co-host and moderator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ejk24_XWeI\">The video is now on YouTube</a> with the shared resources. The transcript is in the works. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And &#8220;Welcome&#8221; to our new subscribers, who came for the show and stayed for the Weekend Edition. 💞 So happy to have you! </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Gutenberg team</strong> has changed their release cycle slightly. Instead of 2 days between Release Candidate and new version, they give themselves and others 7 days to tests the new version. This changed the schedule a bit for the next release. </p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>9.6 will be released on Dec. 23 (RC on Dec. 16th) </li><li>9.7 will be released Jan 6th, with RC on Dec. 30th) </li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark and I will be on holiday break and our next episode of the Gutenberg Changelog podcast will be recorded on January 8th, 2021, and cover both releases. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>To bridge the time, I suggest you read two posts by <strong>Matias Ventura</strong>, architect for Gutenberg and learn more about the current state of affairs. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/12/10/status-check-site-editing-and-customization/\"><strong>Status Check: Site Editing and Customization</strong></a><br />It&#8217;s an excellent summary of the current status of Gutenberg&#8217;s Phase 2. It&#8217;s a bit longer, you probably should get another cup of hot beverage and get comfortable reading in. It definitely is worth your time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/27331\">Sidebar Controls &amp; Component System</a></strong><br />&#8220;The first half of this year brought some needed updates to the design language of blocks, with a strong focus on improving the block footprint, toolbar system, and the inserters. Now it’s time to revise the state of block controls primarily used in the sidebar and its underlying component set. This is the next widest topic for the evolving design language.&#8221; wrote Ventura. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n\n\n<h2>Theme Development</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Kjell Reigstad</strong> published the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2020/12/11/gutenberg-themes-week-of-dec-7-2020/\">31st update on Gutenberg + Themes</a> with the week&#8217;s discussion on theme related issues, updates and fixes to theme related editor aspects.

Welcome to the 21st Gutenberg Times Live Q&amp;A. My name is Birgit Pauli-Haack and I&#8217;m your host and the publisher of Gutenberg Times. Thank you all for watching and joining us on this short-term notice, kind of two days before the event. Today&#8217;s show, we will discuss a multitude approach on customizing the block editor for clients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Victor Ramirez is here with me and we will take a look at how he and his team approach it. Thank you, Victor, for taking the time and putting this together. Walk us through the process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ll do some proper introduction in less than a minute. I have just a few housekeeping notes. As you all know, there is on the right-hand side &#8230; oh, on the bottom of the screen you see the chat window and that&#8217;s where you can post comments and say hi and where you&#8217;re coming from or where you&#8217;re watching from. Then there&#8217;s another one that says Q&amp;A and that&#8217;s when you can put in your question and I will then, with Victor, kind of answer those. On YouTube, we are also live now and there&#8217;s on the right-hand side, there&#8217;s the chat window where you can leave your questions and your comments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you, all, for watching. Also those that are watching this on the re-run, welcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if you make sure that you keep your questions question-like, not so much a blog post but more a question, and then also keep it family-friendly. Even if you disagree, be kind. That&#8217;s part of our housekeeping here. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, Victor, you agreed to come to the show and I get an hour with you to talk about your work. But let me introduce you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Victor Ramirez is the lead on product analytics engineer at The Knot WW, and formerly worked at Dow Jones and the Wall Street Journal until about nine months ago, and he&#8217;s also co-organizer for WordCamp New York City. One of my favorite WordCamps, of the WordPress MeetUp. He&#8217;s also the founder of Abstract Agency, doing digital marketing and content strategy for customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, Victor. How are you and what&#8217;s new in your life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Just living through a pandemic like everyone else and just moved into a &#8230; you and I were just talking before. I moved into a co-working space to kind of get out of the house a little bit. I am isolated, though. I&#8217;m in my own little two desk space. Just moved in, so there&#8217;s &#8230; I don&#8217;t know if anyone sees the mess behind me. But yeah, doing that. And interesting enough, this year, even though it&#8217;s been a terrible year for the economy, I&#8217;m very lucky. Still employed, fingers crossed, at The Knot, but also my side business doing WordPress has been busier than ever just because clients are looking for ways to streamline content creation, and I&#8217;ve been working a lot with that, so I&#8217;ve been really busy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Wow, that&#8217;s awesome. I&#8217;ve had actually the same occurrence with February, March I got really busy and it got busier, busier. Right now, I&#8217;m still a little bit in the summer, summer ditch a bit which is actually good for recovering. So, I say hi to Ramona from Colorado. Hi to Rita from Reno. Thanks for saying hi in the chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You got my attention when you, Victor, when you tweeted over Labor Day weekend, and I think not only my attention but somebody else. Very quite insightful and succinct. This four-tiered approach on customizing block editor for clients. I think it&#8217;s very helpful for developers, aspiring developers and also developer designers who are just getting started with WordPress or Gutenberg. You started out with, because I&#8217;m overly opinionated &#8230; aren&#8217;t we all, Victor? The progressive plan for customizing WordPress Gutenberg and level one &#8230; so we have levels one, two and three. Then they require zero plug-ins and 90% cascading side sheets and level four. So do you want to walk us through the levels and kind of get started on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, Andre.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yeah. Yeah, so the &#8230; it&#8217;s interesting. So my girlfriend and my coworkers have been telling me to begin to document the stuff that we&#8217;re doing because one of the things that I&#8217;ve gotten really, and I think it&#8217;s just from being involved in the meetup, in the WordCamp, and as like a quick FYI, every time a speaker flakes, and I don&#8217;t mean flakes. Things happen, people get busy, people can&#8217;t make a call. So I will step in as the speaker and so the challenge to me is then to have to write something quickly and what I do is at my day job, not just at The Knot doing analytics but my side business doing WordPress, most of the work I do is educating my developers and educating my clients about how we use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what I had to begin to do was &#8230; so I guess like my one teammate, she calls them Victor-isms, and they&#8217;re things that where I compartmentalize ideas to be in very kind of digestible steps that not only allow us to communicate to the client, but to communicate to the developers and communicate to the larger groups. For example, and this comes from the concept of when I was at Dow Jones, it took us two months to get a local environment set up, and I said, &#8220;Guys, it should take one day. Why does it take &#8230; a student can set up tensor flow in a weekend,&#8221; tensor flow&#8217;s a machine learning algorithm from Google, &#8220;and it takes us two months to set up a local environment for a WordPress website.&#8221; Now I keep that in my mind when I work with clients and I work with developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We recently hired some developers from offshore. One developer&#8217;s based in Vietnam, one&#8217;s based in Brazil, and then I work with a developer in Croatia. Every developer has their own approach, so what I wanted to do was try to one, have a uniform approach but two, I wanted to hire from less &#8230; from different talent pools. So one of the things when I hired the person that I hired from Vietnam, he&#8217;s like 23, just graduated college with two kids so he&#8217;s a very busy guy, and the other person, this young woman in Brazil, she is mainly a view developer, not a WordPress developer, but she knows WordPress enough.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So by doing this kind of leveled framework of where I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Hey guys,&#8221; they immediately would go, &#8220;Yeah, no, I&#8217;m going to go away for four weeks and do all this the way I do it and research things.&#8221; Now that could lead to a nightmare because some people might use ACF for fields, someone might use Metabox for fields, someone might roll their own fields. Again, think about all the things that are involved in a WordPress, basic WordPress project, right? Whereas I said, &#8220;Hey, I don&#8217;t want you to go away for four weeks because by the time that happens, WordPress could change completely, Gutenberg could change. Let&#8217;s work incrementally. What could we do in a week? What could we do in two weeks?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I add a developer, the developer from Vietnam when I tested him before being hired, I gave him an HTML template to add in and he added the HTML template and knew how to use Gulp and SaaS and because of that, he was more able to get to what I would say the level two or level three of my tweets better than some WordPress developers because a lot of WordPress developers are so focused on PHP. They&#8217;re still using PH &#8230; most WordPress plug-ins and tutorials are still using PHP 5. You can cut and paste from PHP 5, 6. So what I tried to do was say, &#8220;Hey, let&#8217;s break this down where it&#8217;s just what can I do? What can I have a low level developer from Vietnam, Brazil, who&#8217;s just starting out do in three steps?&#8221; So the first three levels, I can hand them a handbook, walk away, and one week later they&#8217;ve completed it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So the level one is kind of &#8230; has three things on it, right? One is style the editor and the core blocks to match the client theme. Then this enables the custom colors and the fonts to keep the client on brand, and then disable all core blocks that your client doesn&#8217;t need for post type. Too many options are confusing. I totally agree with that. So style the editor and core blocks to match the client theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What other tools that you suggest to developers? You linked a page, or a website, an article by Rich Tabor saying how to add retro theme styles to Gutenberg. I&#8217;m going to share that link.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yeah, and if you want, what I can do also share my screen about….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: I brought up &#8230; so WordCamp Phoenix, I did a talk about Gutenberg and the joke was that you don&#8217;t even need to know a reactor JavaScript to do half the things that we&#8217;re doing here. So this is my &#8230; and by the way, after the call, or after this Zoom or YouTube or whatever we&#8217;re calling it these days, this is a repository. It&#8217;s public. It&#8217;s on my GitHub user name is victorious. It&#8217;s WCHPX 2020. Shout Out out to WordCamp Phoenix. That was a really fun time. They had laser tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So basic WordPress &#8230; so if you see, the first step was style the editor and the core blocks to match the client theme. What I did was I would say to them, &#8220;Hey, look, the first thing I set up, and I even have it on my own personal site to show you guys,&#8221; I have them set up Richard Tabor&#8217;s block unit test. So that is not actually available in the WordPress repository anymore, but Richard Tabor&#8217;s project was acquired by GoDaddy and he was acqui-hired, but the plug-in is still available on the Go Daddy repository.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first thing my developers do is they go in and install the block unit test and what the block unit test does is creates every single available version of every single core block in the system and creates a mega page. Then what we do is if the developer &#8230; sorry, if the client already has brand styles, then we just match the brand styles to this. So for example, this is Heading One, Two, Three through Six, and we will then say to the client, &#8220;Do you have any alternate styles?&#8221; What we will do is then we will add, and this is in the level two I&#8217;ll talk about that, but we say, &#8220;Hey, do you have any H One through Six?&#8221; And it&#8217;s kind of funny. A lot of times, clients won&#8217;t have these styled, and this is one of the most frustrating things about WordPress. A lot of times when agencies sell a theme, they sell an incomplete theme. They sell a theme that only designs what the clients sees, whereas with this block unit test, we&#8217;re designing everything the client could potentially see in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have the designer go and style these on the front end and on the back end as well so that not only when the user or the site owner is interacting with the blocks, they are interacting with it, excuse me, in the way that the user would. So we expect the same thing from our developers and it&#8217;s a challenge to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in level one, they&#8217;re going and &#8230; let me just jump into this site to show you how the block unit test actually works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Mm-hmm. Yeah. That&#8217;s cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: So when that loads, like I said, from Richard Tabor, the block unit test and that plug-in goes and creates a page, and that page I have here called Block Unit Test, and the other thing, too, is we say to the developer, because a lot of times developers will just go and style the front end and they&#8217;ll go &#8230; and so many developers I found are used to the WordPress backend just being ugly and not looking nice. So what I say to them, &#8220;No, no. Look. This has to work this way and the client should be able to &#8230;&#8221; so that&#8217;s the level one, right? Just go and style all the things that are available in the core blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The level two is disable custom colors and fonts. This isn&#8217;t on my site, but I can just let you know why this is a problem. You give this client this beautiful H 1. It matches their branding exactly. Then the client goes and instead of going to H 6 to make it smaller, they go and &#8230; oh, sorry. We did disable this. We remove the default font picker so they can&#8217;t go and pick the font size for these. The reason we do that is we don&#8217;t want the client to go and highlight this and then go make this font size 35 and all of sudden, they&#8217;re not using the H 1 in the way that it was meant &#8230; they&#8217;re going to take an H 6 and resize it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing is we usually disable custom colors, but we import the client colors. You can do a color palette for the client and have all their colors there, and then remove the custom color because in reality, they&#8217;re just going to go and do something silly like put a black font on a dark blue background and make it unreadable. So we restrict that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then in that same thing, we go and disable core blocks, and this is actually &#8230; this is kind of a nightmare. I have these things, there&#8217;s the affiliate&#8217;s image. That&#8217;s from my site, and I&#8217;m a WordPress user so I know what needs to be there, like layout elements, but one of the things we found is that clients &#8230; the column system is just not, and this isn&#8217;t any &#8230; it&#8217;s not even just like &#8230; it is not the system because Beaver Builder, Elementor, they&#8217;ve kind of been working on columns for four years. Clients just don&#8217;t understand columns. They&#8217;re never going to get a column to work correctly on mobile. So what we do is we disable the column picker, we disable Spotify, and we create a spreadsheet.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I actually do is I go and I actively do a rest API, call up all the available blocks, dump it to a spreadsheet on a monthly basis, and when we onboard a client, we quickly go through and go, &#8220;Here&#8217;s your suggested configuration and here&#8217;s some blocks that we&#8217;re turning off. Do you think you need Spotify?&#8221; And the clients are like, &#8220;No,&#8221; and it&#8217;s very easy to turn off, by the way. Just to show you what I wanted to show you was in the repository that I shared from WordCamp Phoenix, I didn&#8217;t get into block development but I got into customizing the editor. What we went and did on every single type, this is &#8230; we create a custom functionality plug-in, and again this is more modern development that WordPress developers may not be used to. They go into everything into functions.php. The problem is if you throw everything into fucntions.php, and you change your theme, you lose everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we go and add all of our blocks &#8230; sorry, all of our custom functionality that is not related to the theme into a file in a core functionality plug-in. In that core functionality plug-in, we require, once all the types and so for example here, we have this type of service and I think it&#8217;s the type of case study, I think, is where we removed &#8230; we did a block white list in one of these, so this was in February that I did this talk so I forget &#8230; ah, here we go. So in this February talk, all we do is run this big function, and I know I don&#8217;t normally like commented code left in a PR, but we leave this here so the client can just go and say &#8230; the client goes, &#8220;Oh, I want gallery back.&#8221; Okay, we comment it back on. &#8220;Okay, we want this back.&#8221; Oh, we turn it back. In each CPT file, we just have this big directory of the available blocks. So for this promotion, we limited it to only paragraphs, images, and headings for this CPT.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: CPT is custom post type?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: The other thing I do, just if anyone asks custom post type. Custom post type. Correct. Sorry. Thank you for that. I forget that we&#8217;re &#8230; outside the WordPress, we get in our little bubble.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s okay. That&#8217;s okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yeah. There&#8217;s some other things that I highly recommend in this. Always document your functions. So we document the function of what it does. Restricts blocks for promotions post type. Put a link, so you can do at link. Again, if you borrow this repo, I put a hot link to every single function and you can command click it in VS Code or PhpStorm, and that way instead of my developers coming and going, &#8220;How&#8217;d you do that?&#8221; I literally link to every single thing because I&#8217;m not that smart and it makes it easier. So we&#8217;re documenting in the code, where the developers then, we go and hack and borrow from our own code.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s level one and that was a lot, but those little things all of a sudden, cleaning up the client theme so it looks exactly how they want it, removing certain functionalities so they can&#8217;t make it look the way they don&#8217;t want it, because you don&#8217;t want a phone call when the client goes, &#8220;All my text is blue when I&#8217;m green,&#8221; and then disable the blocks they don&#8217;t need and then already the editor is much cleaner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So there are, I think, two functions. One is to disable the core block colors and the other one is disable the core block font types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Correct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Okay. Yeah. Yeah, and the &#8230; you said you used the API column to clean, install, and then have that in a spreadsheet when you try to serve all available blocks?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yeah. So let me actually bring up my &#8230; in my other window, I have it. Let me &#8230; I&#8217;m just looking for it because we&#8217;ve done so many client projects recently with this, but it is called 03 and it is structure, so one second here. I&#8217;m actually going to show you one of the spreadsheets that we do this with, and it&#8217;s called &#8230; I&#8217;m in another window. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when we go and plan out the CMS, and this is something we&#8217;re doing now for clients, and I&#8217;ll show you guys in the window, we go &#8230; we don&#8217;t even work in the CMS with the client, because the client, they start to get blind. They go and see all these things in CMS, so we work in spreadsheets, and this client, for example, they had &#8230; their dashboard had all this garbage in there and so we were like, &#8220;Hey, we&#8217;re going to go and make it so all these are hidden and sliders, etc.,&#8221; then we go and get the types and then finally what I do is I hit the rest API and the rest API gives you all the available blocks. It can print out all the blocks. And we just shoot it into a spreadsheet and we go &#8230; if you recognize, let me zoom in a little bit here. If you recognize common formatting, all of these blocks, we go and say to the client, &#8220;Hey, which ones will be available per post type?&#8221; So the blog will have paragraph, we&#8217;re turning off audio, we&#8217;re going to turn on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then also to make it easier for the client to understand, we go and link to every single &#8230; we do a demo where they as the &#8230; because everything&#8217;s remote and I kind of, not that I don&#8217;t like phone calls, it&#8217;s just exhausting to be talking all day. And so what I do is I say to the client, and also the client, I&#8217;m working with a CMO or marketing director or a manager, they don&#8217;t want to have to go and bother them so what they do is they can share this in a 20-person team and they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Well, what&#8217;s a quote block and how does that work?&#8221; Then I link to that for each one and then they go and &#8230; they just go and, &#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s a quote block and that&#8217;s great. Wait a minute. But our quote blocks should look different,&#8221; and that brings me to level two where we go and say, &#8220;Hey, you can choose styles,&#8221; and that&#8217;s how we demo this. We say, &#8220;Hey, look. There&#8217;s quote style one and quote style two, but we can do &#8230; what&#8217;s your brand&#8217;s quote style one and quote style two?&#8221; So yeah, so that&#8217;s how we plan that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome. Thank you for sharing that. Yeah. So any questions for this level one customization from our people that are watching? Well, hi, Yuca, on YouTube. She had a comment. Although seeing the Gutenberg engine already, but definitely interested in this show. Super big thanks. Okay. Cool. There was this funny joke, you saw it kind of. Are those short stack developers instead of full stack developers? That&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yes. Yeah, and it&#8217;s &#8230; but I think the thing, too, is we don&#8217;t &#8230; it&#8217;s not even like we&#8217;re not trying &#8230; I&#8217;m not hiring developers that are purposely lower skilled. It&#8217;s that also there are some developers who just to get up and running on WordPress, it&#8217;s so much work. It&#8217;s easier to find someone, in my opinion, who understands semantic HTML, CSS, and build tools, and then we disable the PHP engine and we just say, &#8220;Hey, look, now the WordPress site, the template, looks the way it needs to look, the HTML template looks the way it needs to look. Please go and use JavaScript and CSS to add the UI functionality that we need for the client to be happy.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. I totally get it, yeah. So if that&#8217;s level one, what&#8217;s level two? It says customize the core blocks by adding block styles, and then extend the existing functionality. Example, you don&#8217;t need a custom testimonial block. What you actually need is a block quote with a custom style and a link attribute. That&#8217;s kind of the next tweet. There was a lot of information in this Twitter thread.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Right. So I don&#8217;t have &#8230; again, I don&#8217;t have styles loaded from a client, but if you guys steal somebody&#8217;s screen, this is a default functionality of WordPress core. So again, this is not anything custom. This is the default block quote from WordPress and it comes in two styles, default and large. What a lot of people may not realize is you can then &#8230; what this large is actually doing, and all it&#8217;s doing, is it is going and adding a wrapper, a class wrapper, around this block quote, with the class of let&#8217;s say large, right? And then so when I go to that quote, so then the client comes to us and says, &#8220;Oh, well, our block quote looks a certain way.&#8221; We can just go to this actual &#8230; find the block quote and see it says is style large, right? Well, now I just go look for that is style large in my CSS, and I could go and target only that particular style large class, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you go, and that&#8217;s why kind of that Richard Tabor tutorial, and actually I think the other one that&#8217;s really good that keeps it very straightforward, Bill Erickson does Gutenberg styles and he does block styles. Again, because I don&#8217;t have an option ready, he shows two versions. He just modified large and modified a regular, right? Again, you can just use the default styles, but then you can add an additional style by adding a JavaScript call. You do need a custom JavaScript file for your core editor and you can see here, some of what I was talking about before, he did Heading 1 through 6 one style, had a style two. So it&#8217;s about &#8230; I think it&#8217;s about 10 lines of code. You&#8217;re creating and queuing custom scripts that load in the editor and then he is registering the custom style and he labeled it alternate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they&#8217;re doing the same thing here in core, where they&#8217;re saying is large. You&#8217;re going to do is alternate, and then your new style will be available for each of these. You can do these for any of these. You can make your headings &#8230; I worked with clients where when you add that style, now that style will be pickable there, and that happens all the time where a client may have a cursive font or some kind of CTA font they want. You can do that even with buttons. We have, and actually I think that&#8217;s in core, in core there&#8217;s button style one and button style two. Actually, this is from this theme that I&#8217;m using. So you can go build your own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then extending the custom functionality, again I don&#8217;t have one right in front of me right now, but we had a client that wanted to do quotes, and what we did was we found okay, they wanted quotes with a link to the author&#8217;s name. All we did was we extended it, and I think linked in there to add extended functionality. That&#8217;s from Jeffrey Carandang. Sorry, Jeffrey, if I&#8217;m butchering your name. I know we&#8217;ve met twice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he has it&#8217;s extending blocks and it&#8217;s Jeffrey Carandang. So all you do is again, basic JavaScript. Now that you&#8217;ve added that basic JavaScript file that loads particular styles, you can use that same JavaScript file to add an attribute. What you can see he&#8217;s doing here is he is adding a custom attribute to a core Gutenberg block of like, and it adds an attribute and what it looks like it&#8217;s doing here is it&#8217;s assigning an attribute of visible on mobile and he&#8217;s registering it to &#8230; let me see here. Where he&#8217;s passing it? Right. Custom panel control. See, he added mobile, and this is a toggle. Mobile device visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So recently we did that for a client where all we did was we added a text field and let them add a URL, and we didn&#8217;t add a custom testimonial block. All we did was add a custom attribute of a URL and they could click &#8230; they could highlight here, or click there, and have the URL and add the link. So you can modify the basic WordPress blocks very easily. So what we try to do is when we go and work with a client on a project, we work through these and we say, &#8220;Okay, do they need level one, level two, level three,&#8221; and that gives us also a better way to scope time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, that&#8217;s what I was saying here. You don&#8217;t need a testimonial block. And also the other thing, too, is you can actually use Inner Blocks to cheat. I guess I should have put that as a level 2.5, where now ACF has Inner Blocks and even Gutenberg has Inner Blocks. An Inner Block is where you essentially create a block that calls in other blocks. So you can make your own testimonial block by using the H 1, the paragraph, a link, and then an image. Then now, use Inner Blocks to put those in with default attributes and now you&#8217;ve created your own testimonial block, but you&#8217;re not actually &#8230; you didn&#8217;t actually create a block. You&#8217;re just using the core blocks and calling them in a pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, so Juca Pauline has a question on YouTube. Is name scope a problem in doing Gutenberg blocks? Can the component be easily shielded into its own name space?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: So I&#8217;ve not run into any issue, but name spacing is important to make sure when you&#8217;re going and it&#8217;s all about how you build your files. So whenever we&#8217;re working with CSS, prefixing all of our functions, prefixing everything and actually had that in the demo. We&#8217;re building out currently where all of our CSS, all of our JavaScript is modularized where it is all name spaced and so by default, ES 6, and if you guys can see my screen, we go through all of our code and we make sure to name space this &#8230; sorry, I just pulled this down. I have a developer working on it. So yeah, for all that, you will run into name space issues if you don&#8217;t properly prefix, name space, and work with your code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is one of the things that gets frustrating for developers, but that&#8217;s why I recommend, again, starting with level one and two. You really shouldn&#8217;t run into those issues as long as you&#8217;re using the core blocks and you&#8217;re, again, prefixing your functions, making sure to name space things and import properly. But yeah, that will be an issue if you go to scale and you don&#8217;t plan for those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m just making a little pause here to make sure that people who have questions can kind of be more targeted and not have to wait until later. If you have questions about adding custom block styles as well as extending core blocks, now is a good time. Of course, we can do the Q&amp;A later, but just to get the first questions out of the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Then one more thing. On my screen, you might see there&#8217;s this guy, Igor Benic, who&#8217;s really….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Benic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yeah, Benic. Sorry. I&#8217;m going to butcher his name, yeah. So butchering names today. But yeah, so he writes great stuff and he actually wrote this a while back. If you look at this article, he talks about Inner Blocks but the thing I think that he did great was he showed how CoBlocks, which is owned by Richard Tabor, went and used the Accordion lock and the Accordion Block is using Inner Blocks. They didn&#8217;t really go and write their own block, they just used the core blocks to create a block called Accordion that uses Inner Blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m glad that you mentioned that. That is actually one of the most clicked links on one of our resource pages from the Gutenberg Times. It&#8217;s Enable Inner Blocks for Gutenberg. It&#8217;s kind of interesting, yeah. Yeah. Okay. So we have that. I&#8217;m looking around the space and I don&#8217;t see any questions right now. Oh, good. Yuca Pauline says, &#8220;Good tip on naming.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. We are at level three. Build Gutenberg block patterns by grouping together core blocks and styling with CSS. Pro tip, also disable columns. That&#8217;s what you mentioned before. Nobody gets that right. The Gutenberg block patterns is just new in WordPress 5.5, but it was around the Gutenberg plug-in for quite a while, and we have another link to Rich Tabor, How to Build Block Patterns for the WordPress Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Right. So the way that I came into that, I didn&#8217;t even know it was called block patterns because I had not been really following the block pattern build-out. So I left Dow Jones in January and I had not really been involved, kind of like tracking the active development of Gutenberg, but I did go &#8230; and what I was doing was we were using StudioPress Genesis, and a couple of things I actually kind of don&#8217;t like about StudioPress Genesis. I want to give a warning because sometimes I feel like some people may go and purchase something because I recommend it and then get mad because I didn&#8217;t warn them about something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I don&#8217;t like about Genesis is it goes and changes default functional &#8230; I&#8217;m very opinionated in the sense that everything that you do should be as close to core as possible because you&#8217;re doing your clients and your user a disservice. So for example, if I want to change the layout of this to full width sidebar, in default WordPress you would go to page attributes and choose the &#8230; this should say sidebar left, sidebar right, but Genesis does this thing where it does layout. We actually kill this, get rid of this whole custom sidebar and move all the settings back over here via custom attributes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, they had that. It wasn&#8217;t &#8230; again, they may be doing it for a particular reason. We did it and moved it over, and now we&#8217;re moving back to Patterns because before Atomic Blocks and Genesis, before Patterns was out, they had this thing called Layouts, and it actually was Patterns, but built a different way. So we would go and it wasn&#8217;t really well documented, but Atomic Blocks had in their repository you could go and make your own patterns. So these are patterns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you see the way I&#8217;m doing this now, if I want to go and add something here on this page, instead of going add a block, and by the way in the new WordPress, in 5.5 which I don&#8217;t have active right here now, you would go like and instead of just adding a block, these patterns would show up next to your blocks as well and you can add a preview of each one. The layout picker, the way it works from Genesis or Atomic, is if I go and pick a layout and then I go and pick this and I click it, it goes and adds a layout, and what do you know? Three columns, right? I&#8217;ve disabled, again not in this instance, but they went and added in this layout, they went and added columns, they added column gap. So this whole pattern has its own controls, had its own functionality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So now it&#8217;s really restricting the user, but it&#8217;s restricting the user in a good way. If you remember I said remove columns, now it&#8217;s easier because there&#8217;s so many times where a client will say, &#8220;Oh, I want to add two columns,&#8221; but then they go and &#8230; I had a client who was adding &#8230; they kept making columns and trying to put the media text block. If anyone&#8217;s not familiar, the media text is like a hero type image. But they kept trying to put the media text block into four columns and then getting annoyed that it looked terrible on mobile, but they didn&#8217;t understand padding, they didn&#8217;t understand all these things. So what we did was by getting rid of columns and restricting to layouts, they couldn&#8217;t just go and add other blocks in other places. If you see here actually, I can&#8217;t go and add other blocks into this layout.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So by restricting that, you&#8217;re taking away control for the client, but you&#8217;re also giving high value adds where you&#8217;re saying to the client, &#8220;Hey, just give me all of the available patterns or all the things you use, and I will add these for you.&#8221; Now some clients, I hear marketers and people that use Beaver Builder screaming, but what I do is I restrict &#8230; I will go and create a custom post type of promotions and restrict the page builder to only promotions of a custom post type. That way when the user logs in, they can only ruin those pages and then they can fight with the designer on how to get that. But for the primary users, we use this. So that&#8217;s what I like to do there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then yeah, that&#8217;s kind of it, really. They&#8217;re simple. You can build these blocks and similar to Richard Tabor&#8217;s tutorial, once I build out a group of blocks, I can just take that group and then export it and turn it into a pattern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, and that&#8217;s what Rich is showing. I also shared a link to the Gutenberg Times WordPress Block Pattern resource list, which is actually covering the whole aspect of it, not only how you use them but also how there are plug-ins available that you can install as a site owner on your site, and then create, with the core blocks, your pattern so to speak, and then save it to the Pattern and it will show up as a pattern in your inserter. Those are quite nice. There&#8217;s some other cool links in there, also.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I found three themes that do block patterns quite well, so you can actually look at them and maybe learn from it and do some creative inspiration there. But that is &#8230; with 5.5, it has been &#8230; I think it&#8217;s a game changer, block patterns, because it can be done by anybody to do these templates but you don&#8217;t really need JavaScript for it. What Rich is showing is actually how to put it in your Functions page or a separate plug-in but also using the block editor to create them. You can style them and everything, so it&#8217;s really interesting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would suggest that any designer and developer to learn more about block patterns because it helps you so much with the Gutenberg and making really good with the clients, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. So, but we &#8230; as you said in your tweet, we still have not created a single custom block, installed any plug-ins, or added any dependencies, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So now we come to level four, or do we have questions before we go to level four? No question here. Nope. Nope. Yeah, go ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Okay, cool. Yeah, so on the level four, and again, there was actually someone that commented on the tweet, or the tweet storm I guess, that I did and they said, &#8220;Oh, I don&#8217;t agree about ACF.&#8221; I&#8217;ll be honest. I actually, when I was at Dow Jones, I kind of began to not like Advanced Custom Fields but the other thing was I &#8230; and I think a lot of developers make this mistake that you are in the WordPress developer bubble because what happens is you end up thinking, &#8220;Yeah, man. It&#8217;s just easy to maintain a block,&#8221; and it&#8217;s like if it was so easy to maintain code, I mean look at it like, what is it? Space Jam? Has anyone ever seen that, by the way? The Space Jam website, the Michael Jordan cartoon movie, the website&#8217;s still standing, I think 20 years later. Twenty years later this site is still standing, right, but if we were to go and look at the source code it is just plain HTML. There&#8217;s nothing in here. There&#8217;s no scripts. There&#8217;s nothing. I think there&#8217;s a script for a policy update warning and that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: There&#8217;s a tracker, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yeah, where as modern development, there&#8217;s so many different changes, so many things going in and when you are &#8230; and you&#8217;re doing yourself, in my opinion, a disservice. You can&#8217;t be mad at a client who pays you $10,000 for a website and then when you &#8230; when a block breaks they call you three months later to fix it and you&#8217;re like, &#8220;Oh, that will be another $500,&#8221; because now you&#8217;re charging them 5%. They&#8217;re abstracted from that mentally, meaning where they are like &#8230; and the one reason I bring that up, too, is I would say at Dow Jones and I even say at The Knot, we&#8217;re competing with Domino&#8217;s and the reason is that the user experience, when you go and order a Domino&#8217;s pizza, there&#8217;s a pizza tracker and you can watch from the minute the person puts the pizza in the oven to the minute the person delivers the pizza. For $10, that&#8217;s the user experience they get. People don&#8217;t realize there&#8217;s a 500-person development team at Domino&#8217;s who&#8217;s building their infrastructure systems, but to the user, they&#8217;re like, &#8220;Why does my $10 pizza have a better user experience than my $10,000 website,&#8221; right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So one of the big things that I brought from being in enterprise development to now still doing websites for marketing for start-ups for their marketing websites is kind of how&#8217;s this thing going to stay standing? So AVF may &#8230; it doesn&#8217;t have inline &#8230; the one thing that drove me nuts, it didn&#8217;t have inline editing, right? You&#8217;re essentially just putting fields inside of the Gutenberg editor. The one thing that it does do is it handles the dependencies. Your client only has to worry about updating Advanced Custom Fields. They don&#8217;t have to worry about updating low dash, updating babble, updated web pack, updating all these JavaScript technologies, right? So ACF is really beneficial for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, of course, if you&#8217;re dealing with an enterprise client where you&#8217;re on an annual retainer and you have the development hours, go for it. Build custom blocks, right, but like I said, if you don&#8217;t have a client on a retainer and they&#8217;re not doing a maintenance plan you&#8217;re putting yourself in for a world of trouble by not using Advanced Custom Fields. The other thing, too….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Especially now, yeah. Especially now that Gutenberg is still so volatile, changing APIs left and right and CSS and all that. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Right. And JavaScript and the web in general is getting volatile with core web vitals now, the way that we track speed. Everything&#8217;s changing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the beauty of Advanced Custom Fields is that, and actually I can even show you. Let me see if I have a demo available. So this is &#8230; let me see if this still works. Give me one second. And probably not, but let me see if I get in here. Give me one second. And auto fill. Nope, that&#8217;s the old one. Other pro tip, use a password manager always.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Victor Ramirez: And so….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, so I shared in the chat the link to the documentation for ACF guide, how to do blocks, so people can then study for themselves later on. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yeah. And so this is actually one of my favorite examples of what we do now for clients. This is like full circle WordPress 101, okay? This is actually &#8230; this is what I spoke about at WordCamp Phoenix. If you go and borrow that repo, it&#8217;s what I built in here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the number one thing that drives me nuts at most WordPress build-outs is you will see here that notice it says Search. That should say Search Testimonials. But even Modern Tribe Events Calendar Pro, when you go and hit view or whatever, it will say when you hit Add a New Testimonial or you publish a testimonial or publish an event, it will say View Post. That drives me crazy. It&#8217;s not a post, it&#8217;s an event. Again remember, get out of your WordPress bubble. Outside of the WordPress bubble, that is very confusing because you know that an event is a custom post type because you&#8217;re in the bubble. Outside the bubble, they don&#8217;t know that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the other thing is that on most people when they go and create CPTs, they leave this button up here that says View Posts, View Testimonials. Well, this testimonial is headless, meaning where we don&#8217;t even allow &#8230; there&#8217;s no render. And so what people don&#8217;t realize you can do, and I did this at WordCamp Phoenix, is you can go to the type of testimonial, and I did this here. I went and disabled &#8230; I changed all the labels to match exactly which is insert testimonial, view testimonial, filter testimonials, et cetera, et cetera. I go and remove &#8230; I leave the title, by the way. It drives me nuts when people change the default title to an ACF field. There&#8217;s so much rich functionality that the default title field does. You&#8217;re creating work for yourself. Don&#8217;t do it. So I change that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then we go and do this kind of work, and again it&#8217;s documented here at site point, where we go and it says testimonial updated, testimonial created, and if there is no front forward facing publicly queryable link, it will not say view update. It will just say updated. It won&#8217;t say view updated testimonial.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So why does this all matter? The reason this is great is now we have this set up where there&#8217;s a front-end submission form where the client, via gravity forms, can send it to the user, they go and fill out the form with their testimonial. When the testimonial &#8230; and then they see it as a draft. The client goes into the testimonial and then publishes it. If you see here, just standard ACF, they can go and see here. It gets categorized, the testimonials, the user image, and then the program type. The reason I&#8217;m showing you CPT when I&#8217;m talking about blocks or ACF and blocks is now this user can go and simply add this testimonial wherever they want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that we&#8217;ve written these &#8230; let me just go here. The way that we&#8217;ve written these blocks is if the testimonial that they chose has been deleted, it will fall back to the most recent testimonial. So that way if the client forgets to put a testimonial, and so I can go here. And the other thing we did was we put the user&#8217;s &#8230; we put the site&#8217;s keywords into each custom block. So if you see here, this is ACF, ACF, ACF. So they have SEI testimonials, and then it by default lists all the testimonials but they can go pick one, they can select the testimonials. So a lot of the stuff that I see people doing with custom blocks, the client doesn&#8217;t want a custom block. All they want to be able to do is get the content into here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now an example of that is you go and get a tool like &#8230; I was using, in my younger days when I was in WordPress, eight years ago, I would go and reach for a plug-in. I would go and say, &#8220;Okay, they want testimonials. What&#8217;s the best testimonials plug-in? Tick, tick, tick. Okay, what&#8217;s the best whatever?&#8221; And then there was a great plug-in called like Super &#8230; not Super. Great Testimonial &#8230; there was a great testimonial plug-in, but the user would have to go and create a testimonial view, then take that testimonial short code and paste it where they wanted it. Then they would have to go and add the testimonials in the testimonials section. That was actually good &#8230; so you&#8217;re sending the user all these places.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now think about this. The people who maintain this site, they don&#8217;t have to actually go and create the testimonials. They&#8217;re submitted to a page. They go and get an alert when there&#8217;s a new testimonial via Gravity forms that needs to be approved. They approve it and then the people creating the content can just go and grab the testimonials and add them where they want them, swap them out, select the testimonials here. They can even go taxonomy. So now you&#8217;ve made this &#8230; and there&#8217;s nothing to change, there&#8217;s nothing here. They can&#8217;t really break it because they&#8217;re not actually choosing the testimonials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now some people might say, &#8220;Well, why not just make a testimonial block they can fill in,&#8221; right? Well, you&#8217;re assuming that someone wants to go and change the testimonials on 50 different pages, right? What I&#8217;m doing here is I&#8217;m giving them hey, you never have to touch this page again because it&#8217;s using a CPT and it&#8217;s querying those.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that even means like when we&#8217;ve done &#8230; outside of this, I&#8217;ve done logo sliders. I&#8217;ve done logo arrays where people show off their favorite clients and all they have to do &#8230; and even bigger, and this is kind of like I don&#8217;t want to jump off Gutenberg, you can use something like WP All Import and there&#8217;s other ones too, that synchronize via CSV and we have clients where they have sites with thousands of posts. They don&#8217;t actually go into WordPress, they edit the event via CSV in a Google sheet. The Google sheet is dynamically being pulled in the blocks and then people can go and style and do whatever they want to do and add different things to the pages, but the events are automatically pulled into CPTs and no one can even actually edit the custom types.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s why I love &#8230; again, I went on a little diatribe there, but that&#8217;s why I love ACF for blocks for CPTs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, very interesting. Good. Then you shared &#8230; so you shared the post with ACF, how to bridge custom blocks, but you&#8217;re still &#8230; so it&#8217;s without code on that side, but you still need to template the block on how it&#8217;s rendered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Right. So that would require &#8230; yeah. And to show you kind of, let me bring it up. SAI. So this is the code base. It&#8217;s not public, sorry. I probably should make an OpenSource of a full theme that we did. Again, we do everything in the functions file. So the types and taxonomies are in the functions file….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Of the plug-in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Of the plug-in, correct. The plug-in function file. But then for the theme, we do put all of the in the lib, all of the blocks which are actually under &#8230; man, I haven&#8217;t touched this in forever, and I&#8217;m actually on the wrong branch, I think. Ah, doo, doo, doo. It&#8217;s under either template parts &#8230; here we go. Template parts. And so for the testimonials, they have the block CSS and this is all it is. Block PHP and it&#8217;s just a loop to, &#8220;Hey, here&#8217;s the loop.&#8221; If the testimonials are ordered by single or by count or selected and remember I told you all we do is go and get basic HTML and this is super basic HTML. It&#8217;s going and getting the post thumbnail, the attachment URL. By the way, that&#8217;s because I prefer thumbnails over custom fields. Gets the attachment responsive. Post meta. And that&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s the template to go and create the block and then the CSS is very light as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, just basic CSS and then the block is actually declared, because again this belongs to the theme itself. The type, the data still exists, but the block belongs to the theme in this case. So in that case, we went and moved &#8230; again, this is crazy. This was built four or five months ago, and now we&#8217;re realizing no, this is not how we want to do it. We want to move these over somewhere else. But we go and register those here, so like that. And that&#8217;s all it is. Like 10 lines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Yeah, and then in the level four, you also shared a link to the 6-Step Guide To Custom Post Loop Gutenberg Blocks by Joey Farruggio, I think was his name. So I&#8217;m going to share that out as well, because you want to….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: And actually my comments are &#8230; I have a super comment on there where I told him, &#8220;Hey man, you probably should not use the word post because people don&#8217;t know what that means. It should be select testimonials,&#8221; and when you see in his tutorial, he literally tells people select post, and that makes no sense. Again, because he&#8217;s using WordPress brain, not user brain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. All right. So well, we are all through the level one with styling, core block disabling parts. Then customizing the core blocks with adding block styles, adding stuff. That&#8217;s the level two. Level three is build the Gutenberg block patterns with a lot of resources there, and then level four is build the custom block with ACF, or if you are willing to do that, you can certainly do this in JavaScript and build your own custom blocks, but for maintainability….</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: By the way, I just saw Carrie &#8230; sorry. I just saw Carrie Delzazon here, by the way. So Carrie, if I did anything stupid with Genesis, tweet me because now I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Uh oh.&#8221; I&#8217;m checking the names to make sure &#8230; yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Carrie &#8230; I steal all of Carrie&#8217;s &#8230; can I just say that the best part of the WordPress community, I feel like we&#8217;re all just Mad Max ripping stuff off each other&#8217;s car and trying to put together hot rods and I borrow Carrie&#8217;s. Carrie&#8217;s like &#8230; if anyone is interested in Genesis after this, go look up Carrie&#8217;s LinkedIn courses, and then also Tonya Mork has this great site called Know the Code, and so I borrow their stuff from Genesis. So I&#8217;m like all these concepts I borrowed from the Genesis community and the Atomic community who gave me a heads-up. You can tell I kind of have my favorite artists that I follow, right? It&#8217;s like a record collection. You have these certain labels and groups. If anyone remembers, you used to follow a record label, you know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah. So Tom, yes. This show will be shared on YouTube and I have the links here. I&#8217;ll put them on <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/\">gutenbergtimes.com</a>. So each of our live Q&amp;As has its own post on the Gutenberg Times with all the links that were shared in a transcript later on. You can always use it as a resource. Carrie Dils just published another article on Gutenberg blocks and Genesis, so we will have that in our newsletter that comes out tomorrow. So if you want to sign up for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Now are there any questions, apart from things? Yeah, hi, Carrie. Any other questions? I see &#8230; yeah, this is awesome. All right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have &#8230; the Gutenberg Times also has the Gutenberg Changelog podcast. The number 28 has been published, or the episode 28 has been published and we will record next week, Friday, after Gutenberg 9.0 comes out and do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other announcements I don&#8217;t have. Do you have anything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if people want to contact you, Victor, thank you so much for leading us through this and giving a little deep insight on how you and your team work this all out. Is there a place &#8230; how can they reach you and if you have anything else that you want to have last words, so to speak?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: One thing I did not mention in this tweet storm, and I probably should add it at the end, is I use WPGulp. It&#8217;s not &#8230; it hasn&#8217;t updated in a minute. It&#8217;s by a guy named Ahmad Awais. WPGulp, there&#8217;s a comment in there &#8230; I think Carrie and I actually uploaded the comment and I even &#8230; the guy has had a &#8230; there&#8217;s a guy who made a PR and it&#8217;s how to split your code between so you can write one file for your fonts and it will automatically split it between the editor and the front end. Same thing with JavaScript, same thing so you&#8217;re not having one giant, 20,000-line front end code item. You can split your code, and I even now have it where I split code by CPT, split code by the editor if we have a really large set of data for our front-end component. So I highly recommend that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to talk to me, just talk to me on Twitter is probably the best space. DMs, there&#8217;s just so much spam out there and that way, too, on Twitter, it makes it I can share answers with everybody. So yeah, check it out on there. That&#8217;s the best &#8230; or even go to &#8230; we have a meetup. Shout out to WordPress NYC. We have a meetup this Tuesday. Luckily I&#8217;m not speaking this week, but someone will be speaking about unit testing and we are 100% virtual, so just go to meetup or just Google meetup WP NYC, and also more of my talks are on <a href=\"https://wpnyc.org/\">wpnyc.org</a>, we record all of those, or you can check me out on WordPress TV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Birgit, you&#8217;re muted, Birgit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, I didn&#8217;t want to &#8230; I muted myself because I was typing and some folks kind of get those vibration on the show. I just shared the WPGulp link in the chat and it&#8217;s by Ahmad Awais, who also is kind of very strong in VS code stuff as well as he was the first with cool grade Guten blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: Yeah. CGB.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So it&#8217;s a great community. Thank you so much, Victor. This was an awesome show walk-through. Within one hour you kind of have the whole development process revolutionized for a few people. Thank you so much and it was great that we had you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Victor Ramirez</em>: By the way, I&#8217;m flattered that you even thought that, so thank you for everyone who was impressed by that tweet, so thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank everybody for attending.

There are many examples of how WordPress has changed people’s lives for the better. In this monthly series, we share some of the amazing stories.</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>To coincide with International Translation Day and the final day of the <a href=\"https://wptranslationday.org/\">2021 WordPress Translation celebration</a>, we feature the story of a WordPresser who has made a major impact in the polyglots team. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Beyond software, meeting the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"600\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i2.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/yordan-min-300x300@2x.jpg?resize=600%2C600&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11299\" />\n\n\n\n<p>For Yordan Soares from South America, finding WordPress also meant discovering friends, community, and opportunities. He had not expected to find a whole global movement behind the web development software.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan, who is from Venezuela, South America, said: “The first time I used WordPress, I had no idea what was going on behind the software or beyond it. I knew there was someone making it all work, but I couldn’t even remotely imagine all the people who were making WordPress not just a tool for developing websites, but a whole movement that comes together to share, build, and help make the world better.”<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Turning your hobby into your job</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Initially, Yordan earned his income from computer technical support and installing networks for small and medium-sized businesses. Back in 2005, web development and code-writing was just a hobby. When he discovered the concept of CSS and how it could make everything dynamic. This opened up a whole new career pathway for him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2010, an introduction to WordPress through a friend opened up a future he had not imagined. He stopped using any other content management system (CMS) and wanted to explore how much he could do with the platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Three years later in 2013, he was able to take his WordPress journey further by starting a small advertising agency with some of his friends. During this time, they crafted commercials for local radio and TV stations. Through WordPress, they found it easy to build more than 15 websites for businesses in a market that previously had not valued the importance of having an online presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: “We were working for almost four years until at the end of 2017 the economic crisis in Venezuela became too acute, and we decided to close the agency when we stopped making profits. Taking stock of that period, I think we changed the way merchants saw the Internet business in the city.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Working full time as a freelancer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One year on in 2018, Yordan began to freelance full-time as a web developer. His first clients were primarily agencies and friends who had emigrated to other countries. Later, he expanded into freelance marketplaces.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that time, getting started as a freelancer was quite a challenging task in Venezuela. The first hindrance was getting a fair level of recompense. Additionally, the deteriorating conditions in the country with constant blackouts and internet connection failures complicated matters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, Yordan was living in Guarenas, where the situation was relatively better. He managed to get a reasonably uninterrupted electricity supply with adequate internet speed, which was just good enough to complete his projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Meeting the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>“Surely if I hadn’t met the community, I would have continued to work on my own, like a lone wolf, doing the ordinary work of solving problems for occasional customers and paying my bills,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Living in Guarenas, Yordan began to experience stability in his career and made new friends and contacts. He began looking for co-working spaces or technology communities nearby, and that’s when he met the WordPress community in Caracas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He quickly signed up for the first face-to-face event. As soon as the event concluded, he went to talk to the co-organizer and offered his help. He was inspired to help with designing promotional pieces, managing social networks, and organizing events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through such events, he met and connected with several people living in nearby cities.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text alignwide is-stacked-on-mobile\"><img width=\"120\" height=\"300\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/WP_Guarenas-Guatire-120x300-1-120x300.png?resize=120%2C300&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11300 size-medium\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-normal-font-size\"> A few months later, with other WordPress users in the area, the idea emerged to start a new Guarenas-Guatire meetup group. The idea became a reality by December 2019, when they applied to the WordPress community team. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the final approvals came in, the team started scheduling the activities. The <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/wordpress-meetup-guarenas-guatire/\">WordPress Guarenas-Guatire Meetup</a> was officially recognized!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the first quarter of 2020, just before the pandemic, Yordan and colleagues organized five face-to-face events. With the worldwide lockdown, in-person community engagements came to a halt. However, the Guarenas-Guatire community was eager to continue meeting.</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>To keep the community active and motivated, and with the support of sponsors, they started organizing online events under a format called “WordPress a la medianoche” (WordPress at midnight).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The format of these events was inspired by Alexis Arnal, who suggested meeting at midnight to make the most of the internet speed that would usually improve somewhat after that time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time of writing, Yordan and the team have organized 16 WordPress a la medianoche events with an attendance of up to 50 people per online gathering. An impressive audience which enabled a comparatively small meetup to keep communications flowing at a difficult and unprecedented time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One positive of such events, is an opportunity to invite people from other countries and run sessions in partnership with others. An example was a special translation event with Javier Esteban, a member of the translation team from Spain. The meetup also invited contributors from Mexico, Costa Rica, Peru, and Colombia who were happy to participate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Strengthened by the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"241\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/09/wp-translation-2020.jpg?resize=632%2C241&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-11307\" />Yordan (pictured bottom left) speaking at the WordPress Translation Day 2020 events\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan believes that he would have continued to work on his own had he not met the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Fortunately, this was not the case and I have been able to live a lot of transforming experiences that have shown me the meaning of the words &#8216;community&#8217; and &#8216;volunteerism&#8217;.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yordan felt empowered by the community and it led him to volunteer for many other roles and activities, including Locale Manager for <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/es-ve/\">Spanish Venezuela</a>, a moderator for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/tv/\">WordPress.tv</a>, and as a <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/support/\">support</a> contributor in the forums helping people with technical issues. He has also developed free plugins for the official WordPress directory and <a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/speakers/yordan-soares/\">spoken at community events</a> including <a href=\"https://spain.wordcamp.org/2020/session/actualizaciones-automaticas-para-tus-plugins-y-temas-personalizados/\">WordCamp Spain 2020</a>.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this has a boomerang effect, Yordan explains. These experiences helped him grow personally and professionally, as it’s always rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also likes being able to directly help people when they need it and feels it is a two-way learning process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At first, when I told my family and friends about the community and the work I was doing, they would ask me &#8216;what do you get in return?&#8217; Perhaps they expected me to tell them a specific amount of money, but the answer is more complex,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s rewarding to know that you’ve helped improve the WordPress ecosystem, the tool you use to work and put food on the table.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his journey, Yordan has met many wonderful people with common interests and values, and the best part is that many of these people are now his friends, business partners, or customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, he has learned new skills and gained experience, which have given him a significant confidence boost in facing difficult situations that may come in life.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"632\" height=\"332\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2021/10/special-acknowledgement-yordansoares.png?resize=632%2C332&ssl=1\" alt=\"Polyglots special appreciation.

His new site, aptly named <a href=\"https://wpblockpatterns.com/\">WP Block Patterns</a>, allows users to preview any WordPress.org-hosted block themes and patterns together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project does not allow visitors to download anything or ask them to sign up. It is a basic demo system, one that WordPress.org should consider at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Visitors can choose any block pattern. Then, they can select any theme to see what they look like together. It is a quick way to test patterns and themes without actually adding them to your WordPress installation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, a user can view the <a href=\"https://wpblockpatterns.com/team-social-cards/?theme=tove\">Team Social Cards</a> pattern &mdash; one that I had a hand in creating &mdash; along with Anders Nor&eacute;n&rsquo;s Tove theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Or, the <a href=\"https://wpblockpatterns.com/image-and-quote-on-a-background/?theme=naledi\">Image and a Quote on a Background</a> pattern with Anariel Design&rsquo;s Naledi theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>From Gutenberg Hub&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-hub-launches-landing-page-templates-directory\">landing page templates</a> to EditorsKit&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/creator-of-editorskit-launches-community-block-sharing-site\">ShareABlock collection</a>, the block system has allowed developers to experiment with unique sites for end-users. Because everything is built upon a standard, I am guessing we will see even more of these creative projects in the future. WP Block Patterns is another step in that journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This was not always the plan for the WP Block Patterns site. Starr set out to blog about patterns after their feature release in WordPress 5.5. After only publishing a single post, the project fell to the wayside. Fortunately, inspiration struck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have a site that I use as my reference point when providing support for my themes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This site has a blend of varying content and code that allows me to quickly switch/preview any of my themes, without the need to actually change the active theme in the admin, or maintain a different site for every theme.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the process of making improvements to his theme-switching functionality, the domain came up for renewal. He had planned to let it expire but decided to see if he could come up with something to do with the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I got the inspiration to use the theme switcher in conjunction with content from block patterns,&rdquo; said Starr. &ldquo;If I hadn&rsquo;t been working on my script at the same time as I coincidently received the domain expiration message, I probably wouldn&rsquo;t have had this idea.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, he is manually installing the themes on the site but may have to automate it in the future as more block themes are released. However, he is pulling patterns and categories directly from the WordPress.org API, which is periodically updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The site only showcases 100% block themes. Technically, it should work with any that supports editor styles. Starr said it had never crossed his mind to showcase non-block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have been keeping my eye on the releases of FSE themes, checking out every block theme that I come across, and it just sort of seems that block themes are the future, and classic themes feel like a step backwards now after investing so much time working with block themes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The site would work just fine with classic themes, but there are so many available I&rsquo;m not sure how to make it manageable or select which themes to feature (and which ones to leave out). I guess that&rsquo;s also something I&rsquo;ll have to think about as the number of block themes increases.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus far, Starr has released two block themes, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/hansen/\">Hansen</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/pria/\">Pria</a>, through his UXL Themes brand. Users can preview both via the site. However, he is already working on his next project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;As a proof of concept, I am working on a classic theme that will have the functionality to also be a block-based theme when FSE is available in core,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The idea is that the user will not notice any front-end differences when the theme &lsquo;switches&rsquo; from classic to block-based, but the user will gain the new FSE admin tools, with the user&rsquo;s classic customizer modifications switched over intact to the new Site Editor. I have found that there are compromises that need to be made when getting classic and FSE to work together seamlessly in a single theme, so I am not sure whether this will be released generally.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also teased a project related to FSE that is neither a theme nor a plugin. However, he was not ready to share any details just yet.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:44:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:55:\"WPTavern: WordCamp US 2021 Kicks Off Online in 48 Hours\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=123520\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:155:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-us-2021-kicks-off-online-in-48-hours?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wordcamp-us-2021-kicks-off-online-in-48-hours\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2517:\"<p><a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp US</a>, WordPress&rsquo; largest flagship event in the Western Hemisphere, is set to   kick off on Friday, October 1, at 11:45 AM EDT.

I should’ve known it was a bad omen of what was to come.</p>\n<p>As the year continued and the world succumbed into the unknown, many businesses closed their doors, among them, most of my clients, my own business and my mental health.</p>\n<p>Of course, when left without income, I applied to as many jobs as I followed people on Twitter who were helping others get WordPress related jobs, but I couldn’t even get an interview.</p>\n<h3>Then Came WordCamp</h3>\n<p>By the time we were busy helping plan for the first WordPress Europe Online, I was asked to become a team rep for design and later joined the 5.5 release team, I even designed the 5.5 About page and showed the world that I am not a visual designer!</p>\n<p>As time passed, I started looking forward to those weekly meetings with the design team, which brought many lessons and stressful evenings accompanied by cheers, smiles, support comments and many virtual hugs. I don’t know if everyone knew I needed them, but they brought me back to life, day by day… week by week, I so much needed those meetings.</p>\n<p>Months passed and I got involved with other teams and got to virtually meet many more contributors and everyone always had something positive to give.</p>\n<p>Last summer, at WCEU at a panel I was asked what my favorite part was from contributing to WordPress and my answer without hesitation will always be “the community”.</p>\n<h3>Personal Triumph</h3>\n<p>I am proud of everything I have done within WordPress but perhaps my most loved project, still in progress, is the recategorization of the end-user documentation. It started as a personal project, now is my gift to the community.</p>\n<p>As I am about to end my tenure as design team rep, I want to reflect into the good things I got from the community: many late nights with the release teams (the release parties are the best), many new friends &#8211; that I am so looking forward to one day meet in person and to hug those that I already know. A better idea of what I want to do in my professional life. An intense learning year about WordPress, leadership, contribution, open source and friendship.</p>\n<p>Thank you to everyone who has in one way, or another been there for me. Thank you to everyone who has been there to mentor and to support other contributors. Thank you to everyone who contributes to WordPress. And lastly, thank you to my two friends and guardian angels, Tammie <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karmatosed\">@karmatosed</a> and Monique <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boemedia/\">@boemedia</a>.</p>\n<h1 id=\"espanol\">Cuando el mundo necesitaba un descanso, la comunidad de WordPress estaba activa</h1>\n<p>Esta no pretende ser otra historia sombría sobre el año 2020, sino un gran agradecimiento a la comunidad de WordPress.</p>\n<p>Todo comenzó cuatro días después de 2020 cuando mi mayor cliente me llamó para pedirme que cerrara su sitio web porque se iba a declarar en quiebra. Debería haber sabido que era un mal presagio de lo que estaba por venir.</p>\n<p>A medida que avanzaba el año y el mundo sucumbía a lo desconocido, muchos negocios cerraron sus puertas, entre ellos, la mayoría de mis clientes, mi propio negocio y mi salud mental.</p>\n<p>Por supuesto, cuando me quedé sin ingresos, solicité tantos trabajos como seguí a personas en Twitter que estaban ayudando a otros a conseguir trabajo relacionado con WordPress, pero ni siquiera pude conseguir una entrevista.</p>\n<h3>Tiempo de la WordCamp</h3>\n<p>Mas adelante, mientras planeábamos la primera WordPress Europe Online, me invitaron a ser representante del equipo de diseño y luego me uní al equipo de lanzamiento de 5.5, incluso diseñé la página Acerca de 5.5 y le mostré al mundo que no soy una diseñadora visual!</p>\n<p>Con el paso del tiempo, comencé a esperar con ansias esas reuniones semanales con el equipo de diseño, que trajeron muchas lecciones y veladas estresantes acompañadas de sonrisas, comentarios de apoyo y muchos abrazos virtuales. No sé si todos sabían que los necesitaba, pero me devolvieron la vida, día a día &#8230; semana a semana, necesitaba tanto esas reuniones.</p>\n<p>Pasaron los meses y me involucré con otros equipos y pude conocer virtualmente a muchos más colaboradores que siempre tenían algo positivo que ofrecer.</p>\n<p>El verano pasado, durante un panel en WCEU, me preguntaron cuál es mi parte favorita de contribuir a WordPress y mi respuesta sin dudarlo siempre ha sido “la comunidad”.</p>\n<h3>Un triunfo personal</h3>\n<p>Estoy orgullosa de mis contribuciones para WordPress, pero quizás mi proyecto más querido, que continúo trabajando en el, es la re-categorización de la documentación del usuario. Este comenzó como un proyecto personal, hoy en día, es mi regalo a la comunidad.</p>\n<p>Ahora que estoy finalizando mi termino como representante del equipo global de diseño, quiero reflexionar sobre las cosas buenas que obtuve de la comunidad: muchas noches con los equipos de lanzamiento (las fiestas de lanzamiento son las mejores), muchos amigos nuevos, que espero algún día conocer en persona y abrazar a los que ya conozco. Una mejor idea de lo que quiero hacer en mi vida profesional. Un año de intenso aprendizaje sobre WordPress, liderazgo, contribución, código abierto y amistad.</p>\n<p>Gracias a todos los que de una forma u otra me han apoyado. Gracias a todos los que han orientado y apoyado a otros colaboradores. Gracias a todos los que contribuyen a WordPress. Y por último, gracias a mis dos amigas y ángeles de la guarda, Tammie <a href=\"https://twitter.com/karmatosed\">@karmatosed</a> y Monique <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/boemedia/\">@boemedia</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 29 Sep 2021 06:00:20 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:12:\"Estela Rueda\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Tue, 05 Oct 2021 02:26:47 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Tue, 05 Oct 2021 02:15:07 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211005022357\";}', 'no');

Hợp đồng điện tử theo quy định pháp luật, cụ thể theo quy định tại Luật giao dịch điện tử năm 2005, hợp đồng điện tử là hợp đồng được thiết lập dưới dạng thông điệp dữ liệu theo quy định của luật này. Giá trị pháp lý của hợp đồng điện tử không thể bị phủ nhận chỉ vì hợp đồng đó được thể hiện dưới dạng thông điệp dữ liệu.\n<h3><strong>Nguyên tắc giao kết hợp đồng điện tử</strong></h3>\n– Các bên tham gia có quyền thỏa thuận sử dụng phương tiện điện tử (phương tiện điện tử là phương tiện hoạt động dựa trên công nghệ điện, điện tử, kỹ thuật số, từ tính, truyền dẫn không dây, quang học, điện từ hoặc công nghệ tương tự) trong giao kết và thực hiện hợp đồng.\n\n– Việc giao kết và thực hiện hợp đồng điện tử phải tuân thủ các quy định của Luật giao dịch điện tử và pháp luật về hợp đồng.\n\n– Khi giao kết và thực hiện hợp đồng điện tử, các bên có quyền thoả thuận về yêu cầu kỹ thuật, chứng thực, các điều kiện bảo đảm tính toàn vẹn, bảo mật có liên quan đến hợp đồng điện tử đó.\n\n– Giao kết hợp đồng điện tử là việc sử dụng thông điệp dữ liệu để tiến hành một phần hoặc toàn bộ giao dịch trong quá trình giao kết hợp đồng.\n\n– Trong giao kết hợp đồng, trừ trường hợp các bên có thỏa thuận khác, đề nghị giao kết hợp đồng và chấp nhận giao kết hợp đồng có thể được thực hiện thông qua thông điệp dữ liệu.\n<h3><strong>Theo đó, các điều kiện khi xem xét tính hợp pháp của một hợp đồng điện tử như sau: </strong></h3>\n<ol>\n 	<li>\n<h4><strong>Hợp đồng đầy đủ chữ ký số của các Bên trong hợp đồng</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\nCũng như cách xem xét hợp đồng giấy, điều đầu tiên cần lưu ý là hợp đồng điện tử cần phải đầy đủ chữ ký số của các bên trong hợp đồng.\n\nTrường hợp hợp đồng điện tử ký giữa tổ chức với tổ chức: cần phải có đầy đủ chữ ký số của các bên trong hợp đồng.\n\nTrường hợp Hợp đồng điện tử ký giữa tổ chức với cá nhân: cần phải có ít nhất 01 chữ ký số của tổ chức và chữ ký số/chữ ký ảnh của cá nhân (tùy theo thỏa thuận của các bên tham gia).\n<ol start=\"2\">\n 	<li>\n<h4><strong>Hợp đồng toàn</strong><strong> vẹn, không</strong><strong> bị chỉnh sửa kể từ</strong><strong> thời điểm ký số</strong></h4>\n</li>\n</ol>\nĐiều kiện thứ hai cần kiểm tra ngay là tính toàn vẹn về nội dung hợp đồng, đảm bảo hợp đồng Hợp đồng toàn vẹn, không bị chỉnh sửa kể từ thời điểm các bên hoàn tất ký số.\n\nTrên nền tảng ký số hợp đồng điện tử FPT.eContract, mọi thay đổi của bất kỳ chi tiết nào, từ bên tham gia ký hợp đồng nào tác động đều được ghi nhận lại.

Doanh nghiệp có thể sử dụng nhiều hình thức ký số như ký bằng ảnh hay bằng chữ ký số token như FPT.CA. Với FPT.eInvoice, việc xuất hóa đơn, ký duyệt, gửi email cho khách hàng được thực hiện tự động theo đúng chuẩn cấu trúc hóa đơn điện tử theo khuyến nghị của Tổng cục Thuế. Với FDA, các doanh nghiệp chỉ mất 8s cho việc thu thập thông tin hóa đơn từ điện thoại, email tập trung, trích xuất dữ liệu cho mỗi hóa đơn đầu vào.\n\nĐơn cử, một ngân hàng thương mại cổ phần lớn tại Việt Nam với hơn 113 chi nhánh trên toàn quốc đã triển khai số hóa quá trình ký kết nội bộ cũng như với đối tác từ xa bằng FPT.eContract từ 2020. Các giao dịch giữa ngân hàng và dân sự cho các khoản vay, mở thẻ tín dụng...sử dụng dịch vụ FPT.eContract đã lược bỏ khâu chuyển phát, tránh mất mát, lưu trữ hợp đồng bảo mật và tập trung, giúp tiết kiệm 70% thời gian và chi phí so với trước đây. Chỉ cần mở email trên thiết bị di động kết nối internet, các cấp phê duyệt luôn có thể xem xét ký số hay ký bằng hình ảnh chỉ với 1 thao tác. Hợp đồng/tài liệu bắt đầu từ khi khởi tạo cho đến kết thúc quá trình ký duyệt cuối cùng đều được đảm bảo toàn vẹn về dữ liệu với các bước xác thực tuân thủ Luật giao dịch điện tử số 51/2005/QH11 ngày 29/11/2005.\n\nHay công ty Logistics Hàng không đã áp dụng xuất hóa đơn điện tử với FPT.eInvoice trên toàn bộ hệ thống 8 công ty con trên toàn quốc. Sau khi ứng dụng hệ thống mới, doanh nghiệp đã có thể đơn giản hóa việc xử lý xuất và hiển thị hóa đơn với dữ liệu lớn, có hóa đơn lên đến hàng chục nghìn dòng một cách nhanh chóng chỉ trong vòng chưa đến 1 phút. Cùng với việc tích hợp FPT.eInvoice đồng bộ cùng hệ thống quản lý doanh nghiệp ERP sẵn có, công ty có thể xử lý hàng triệu giao dịch phục vụ xuất hóa đơn trong tháng nhanh chóng và thuận tiện. Việc ứng dụng giải pháp giúp tổ chức tiết kiệm chi phí in ấn, vận chuyển hóa đơn đến 80% cũng như giúp nâng cao 75% hiệu suất vận hành.\n\nMột đại lý cung cấp dịch vụ Kế toán và kê khai Thuế cho gần 150 doanh nghiệp sở hữu đội ngũ nhập liệu lên tới 15 nhân viên. Sau khi áp dụng FPT Digital Accounting, thời gian xử lý của toàn bộ quy trình, thu thập hóa đơn đã được rút ngắn xuống chỉ còn 10s so với 5-6 phút theo quy trình cũ. 100% hóa đơn được thu thập và ghi nhận vào hệ thống đầy đủ qua các kênh Mobile app và email. Mức độ tin cậy về hóa đơn cũng được đảm bảo do 100% hóa đơn đều được kiểm tra tính pháp lý đầy đủ với Cổng thông tin của Tổng cục thuế. Kết quả, vẫn với số lượng nhân viên như cũ, đơn vị này đã mở rộng dịch vụ cung cấp từ 150 khách hàng lên 230 khách hàng.\n\nThông tin chi tiết về chương trình cũng như cách thức đăng ký để doanh nghiệp có thể sở hữu bộ giải pháp miễn phí có <a href=\"http://giaodichso.fpt.com.vn\">tại đây</a>.\n\nNguồn: <a href=\"https://cafef.vn/doanh-nghiep-tang-cuong-suc-de-khang-voi-goi-giai-phap-van-hanh-giao-dich-so-mien-phi-cua-fpt-is-20210618105430758.chn\">cafeF</a>', 'Doanh nghiệp tăng cường sức đề kháng với gói giải pháp vận hành giao dịch số miễn phí của FPT IS', '', 'publish', 'open', 'open', '', 'doanh-nghiep-tang-cuong-suc-de-khang-voi-goi-giai-phap-van-hanh-giao-dich-so-mien-phi-cua-fpt-is', '', '', '2021-06-21 12:28:21', '2021-06-21 12:28:21', '', 0, 'https://econtract.fpt.com.vn/?p=873', 0, 'post', '', 0),
